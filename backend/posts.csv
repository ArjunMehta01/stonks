ko8iwv,Jan 5 - Most important day for the 2021 stock market,"On Jan 5 Georgia elects its 2 Senators. If Democrats win both Biden can pass tax increases through the Senate and that will hit the stock market.

Interestingly enough Jan 5 is also when the new Congress certifies the electoral votes and elects Boden as President. If Biden dies before Jan 5, Congress can refuse to recognize electoral votes cast for Biden as automatically transferring to Harris. At that point the election is in dispute and it falls to the House of Representatives to elect the President. Interestingly in this election each State delegation gets 1 vote - California gets one vote and so does South Dakota. Republicans control 26 of the State delegations in the current Cingress and 27 in the incoming Congress.

So TLDR If Biden dies before Jan 5, Trump can get elected President.

If Democrats win the Senate, we have a Trump Presidency with a Democrat house and Senate.

ko9bta,Why Salesforce ($CRM) is going to be the next SAP,"I got two goals here. One is for you to understand what Salesforce and SAP really do instead of just ""cloud"" and ""software"" and why Salesforce will become like SAP. The second is to tell you what to expect with CRM price and how to make tendies.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First you gotta understand what exactly SAP does and what happened with their stock. SAP is one of the largest software companies which focus on ERP. What the fuck is ERP you might ask? ERP is what other businesses use to track business resources. This ranges from everything such as planning and optimizing manufacturing capacity to dealing with payroll for employees. Basically companies don't want to create their own software for handling these wide range of tasks and pay SAP a shit load of money to do it for them. Where's the problem you might ask? Unless you are involved with one of these companies that use SAP, it's difficult to understand what the experience is like.

https://preview.redd.it/htsfvr8uro861.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db3b665c95ce5d62639a4dc0e5d9469a08510cbd

Basically a company pays SAP to use their software for dealing with one of these areas of ERP. This generally works fine since SAP has used their business management software with a lot of companies for the same tasks. The issue is when one of these companies want to [customize the software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning#Disadvantages) to meet unique demands for the company. This re-engineering process to fit the ERP system for many tasks ends up costing more for a company and wasting a lot of time and money. Interestingly enough, you can ask almost any business about their experience with SAP and they will all say that they're unhappy even though they use their software. So what you might ask, wouldn't SAP still be generating tons of revenue? Well yes but more of these companies are moving away from this way of doing ERP as it is an inflexible approach. This is becoming replaced by more loosely connected systems utilizing cloud instead of having a one solves all solution.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ugj07ez0to861.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c45c19bcdd0e10bd643286730aa3a2beeec0ae20

Let's look at how their financial earnings and stock price have reflected this. In the past two years this stock has traded relatively sideways with some really bad drops. Around May to August their stock price went up 60% do to the hype around cloud companies benefiting from COVID. However it has obviously taken a really bad fall when October earnings were announced. They claimed that there was slower recovery than anticipated for many of its clients. However I suspect that many of these companies have been looking to shift away from SAP as the pandemic has shown the importance of the flexibility of these systems. By looking at their past quarters, you can see that their quarterly revenue has been flat around the 8 billion range and the company is clearly having a difficult time changing their business model. Other cloud companies are replacing their solutions as SAP's clients move away from their software even though SAP is trying to shift to [modern cloud technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP#Corporate_restructuring). Generally though companies have a hard time changing their business approach from the old way of doing things to the new way of doing things. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now the important part. What the fuck does SAP's troubles have to do with Salesforce. As you may have guessed from the ticker Salesforce provides CRM or customer relationship management. [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) is a specific area in ERP dealing with customer services. For example a company may want a software for their call center or to automate a marketing effort. Salesforce provides software to do this along with analytics of this data so that these businesses can make informed decisions.

As you may have already guessed Salesforce is facing some similar problems that SAP deal with. When a company decides to expand their CRM software to deal with more parts of their business, the inflexibility and costs quickly become apparent. [For example, many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial basis and less than 40 percent of companies have high end-user adoption rates.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management#Criticism) Again if you are not familiar with software development and companies using these software vendors it is difficult to fully understand these troubles. I would strongly recommend researching the issues of customizing ERP or CRM software for a specific company if you are not convinced. While Salesforce tries to provide an all in one solution for their clients, customization becomes complicated and prices become costly. These customizations become difficult to do and take a lot of time, planning, and money. Companies are becoming more inclined to take a different approach for building these systems. In a lot of these cases it is easier for a business to build their own system in the cloud using products from companies such as Microsoft or Amazon for more customizability. 

Another big issue is the concern over customer data with CRM systems. A company might opt to develop their own CRM systems where they can ensure that customer data is obeying customer privacy laws and allows them to have more control over private data. This can help build a better relationship with the customer. Privacy issues over customer data has obviously become a big issue in 2020.

Furthermore, Salesforce has been trying to get into more areas with [recent acquisitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce). Similar to SAP, I suspect that Salesforce will crush over their own weight as they try to expand their company. One good example of this is their recent acquisition of Slack. Slack does not really fit any of Salesforce ecosystem and is really just an attempt to expand into a different area. Slack has a lot of competition from Microsoft teams and other companies which can do what Slack does but better. 

Business will start to move away from Salesforce similar to SAP. This is not to say that they be completely independent as Salesforce does make some parts of the businesses easier. However there seems to be a strong resemblance to SAP based on what I know from inside of a corporation using both SAP and Salesforce and the many issues they face when they try and customize their solutions.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So how can we use this information to print tendies? The expectation is that Salesforce will eventually slow their growth down while stock is overhyped due to being a cloud company and start to fall or go sideways like SAP. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vl629rb14p861.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4282ffef17bd83b9a62a7f196974d0113511b1d5

Basically the idea is to try and play puts, especially around earnings. If Salesforce misses their guidance then it could the stock in a serious reversal especially for a cloud company with a lot of hype. The next earnings will be early March.

You can also try and play longer term puts but the stock is fairly volatile like SAP and I would only do this if you see the price go up significantly.

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; buy puts in march

However, since NIO has swapping stations, NIO qualifies for $2-3k in subsidies.  The starting price for NIO is $56 k (or $46 k if they decide to lease the battery).

kobcex,The TSLA 2021 Trade Plan,"**TLDR:**

Tesla enters 2021 with huge tailwinds. Bullish for the first half of the year. More caution in the second half as competing EV products start entering the market at an accelerating pace. Biggest risk is the market discounting the effect of strong EV competition starting in 2021. Avoid shorting TSLA.

# The 2021 TSLA trade plan

## What moves the stock?

Knowing that TSLA is decoupled from its business metrics, an inquisitive investor will wonder what drives the stock's price. The answer is partially uncovered by understanding who owns the stock. According to Macroaxis.com, as of December 30th, Institutions own 42.52% of Tesla's stock, the Public (i.e. Retail Investors) owns 37.46%, and Insiders own 20.02%.

&gt;Institutional investors aren't selling

TSLA's institutional investor base consists of large passive funds such as funds tracking the S&amp;P500 (which recently added TSLA) to more active hedge funds specializing in innovation and growth. Passive funds increase the buying pressure of TSLA while adding minimal selling pressure. Today, the majority of the workforce regularly contributes their salary to passive funds for retirement and said funds are unlikely to trim their holdings of a stock unless during an infrequent rebalancing event. The active funds that remain invested in TSLA tend to have celestial expectations for the company and are also unlikely to sell at this valuation. For example, billionaire fund manager Ron Baron believes that Tesla, currently at a $659 billion market cap, should be a $2 trillion dollar company. Another major fund manager, Cathie Wood, gives TSLA a 2024 price target of $7,000. Assuming minimal changes in total float, that equates to almost a $7 trillion dollar market cap!

So TSLA's institutional investor base are hardly sellers of TSLA and still believe there is significant room for the stock to run despite its incredible 2020 performance.

&gt;Retail investors aren't selling

What about TSLA's retail investor base? This question is easily answered. Over the years, TSLA has built a diehard fanbase that has equally high, if not higher, expectations of the company than some of the institutional investors. Some people believe the company's CEO, Elon Musk, has developed a cult-of-personality. Tesla's cult-like fanbase manifests online as a large number of YouTube channels and online forums dedicated to the company, and in a broader sense, Elon Musk. For example, the main Tesla subreddit, r/ teslamotors, has more than 901,000 subscribers at the time of writing.

&gt;Insiders aren't selling

Of the remaining 20% of TSLA stock, the majority is held by Elon Musk and he's certainly not eager to sell noticeable quantities of his holdings given the ensuing bad PR.

So if investors are hesitant to sell TSLA, TSLA is bound to appreciate aggressively every time there's good news and appreciate slowly in the absence of news as passive funds and its ardent fanbase continue to buy in. In other words, TSLA is a heavily news-driven stock with a heavy bias for upside.

This is exactly what we saw in 2020. TSLA entered the year having solved its Model 3 production problems while managing to maintain solvent. This act alone unceremoniously discarded a dark cloud over the company on whether it'll manage to produce cars at scale before its heavy debt-burden catches up with the company's treasury. With that, the path was clear for a string of good news to catapult the stock to grandiose heights. They included the opening of the Shanghai factory, the 5-for-1 stock split, the S&amp;P500 inclusion, and record sales and deliveries in the third quarter. Even good news from the tangentially-related company SpaceX, who Elon Musk is also the CEO of, has been positive for TSLA.

# The Plan and Headwinds

Tesla will enter 2021 with boosted by tailwinds from its 2020 success. If Tesla maintains its current pace of execution, ceteris paribus (fancy business major speak for ""all other things being equal""), its stock price is expected to continue to appreciate and befuddle its critics. Tesla is finally able to produce Model 3's at scale, has a foothold in the Chinese market, and is readying to launch the Cybertruck to a red-hot North American pickup truck market. In addition, like Pavlov's dogs, 2020 has conditioned investors to not bet against TSLA with the stock shrugging off multiple negative news events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the expected post-S&amp;P500 inclusion sell-off (which never happened), and the Apple EV announcement.

**In 2021, it's recommended to continue to avoid shorting Tesla, no matter how tempting.**

With that said, there are significant headwinds facing Tesla that any long positions should be aware of. Tesla currently has an 81.66% market share of the US EV market. The biggest risk going into 2021 and beyond is the significant ramp up in EV and battery technology competition from legacy auto manufacturers. Tesla's stock price has only emboldened the executive teams of these companies to pour significant resources into their EV businesses. GM, Volkswagen, and Ford are leading the pack. GM has invested $27 billion into its EV business and is planning to launch 30 EVs by 2025. Two EVs have already been announced: the Cadillac Lyriq and the Hummer EV, with both receiving an overwhelmingly positive public response. GM has also developed an in-house battery technology called Ultium that's the central pillar for its 2025 plan. A step above GM, Volkswagen is investing $41 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 70 EVs by 2030. It's also aggressively investing in battery technology. For example, Volkswagen has a large stake in QuantumScape, a company that claims to be developing a revolutionary solid-state battery technology. Last but not least, Ford is investing $11 billion into its EV business and plans to launch 40 EVs by 2022. Deliveries of its flagship EV, the well-received Mustang Mach-E, is already underway. An honorable mention goes to Apple, which plans to start production of its own EV in 2024.

If TSLA is a news-driven stock, a growing string of negative news about the company's shrinking North American and European market share should apply downward pressure on price. The worry is that investors are so exuberant about the stock's stellar 2020 performance that the effects of emergent, serious competition from legacy auto manufacturers are heavily discounted.

**In 2021, although it remains very bullish for TSLA going into the first half of the year, it's recommended to avoid aggressively starting or adding more to an existing position in the latter half of the year. This is when the rate of competing EV products entering the North American and European markets is expected to accelerate. Prudent investors should watch how the public reacts to this large structural EV market change before making any moves.**

kobv2f,Palantir and Mithril cool names from LOTR or do they have meanings?,"Conspiracy time;

Palantir:

 'A ***palantír*** ([/ˈpælənˌtɪər/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English); *pl.* ***palantíri***) is a fictional magical [artefact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(fantasy)) from [J. R. R. Tolkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien)'s [Middle-earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth) [legendarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkien%27s_legendarium). A *palantír* (from [Quenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya) *palan*, 'far; *tir*, 'watch over'[\[T 1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palant%C3%ADr#cite_note-1)) is described as an indestructible [ball of crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_ball), used for communication and to see events in other parts of [Arda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arda_(Middle-earth)), whether past or future.' - Is this what Palantir will do in the future? See the past or future with their powerful programmes?

Mithril:

The scholar of English literature Charles A. Huttar writes that *mithril* was the only mineral that Tolkien invented. He notes that in Tolkien's underworld, whether the [caves at Helm's Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glittering_Caves_of_Aglarond) or the mines of Moria, ""beauty and terror \[were\] side by side"".[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril#cite_note-Huttar_1975-12) Greed for *mithril* could unleash the terror of the [Balrog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balrog), by digging too far down into the dark realm, but at the same time, he writes, the metal was prized for both its beauty and its usefulness, yielding the best armour. He compares the Dwarves' greed for *mithril* with that of the Barrow-wights for treasure, and indeed that of the [dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon) in [*The Hobbit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit) and [*Beowulf*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf) for gold. In his view, these symbolise the evil ""inherent in the mineral treasures hidden in the womb of Earth"",[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril#cite_note-Huttar_1975-12) just as mining and metalwork are associated with [Satan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan) in [John Milton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton)'s [*Paradise Lost*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost) (I, 670-751). Huttar sums up with a reflection on Tolkien's moral vision in the story: just as the characters at every point have to decide for good or ill, so objects have the potential to be both good and evil: ""Mithril is both the greatest of treasures and a deadly bane. 

Does Peter Thiel actually use the names that have meanings behind them on what the company is going to achieve or is it just some cool names chosen from the LOTR universe?

As we can see Mithril can be used for good and ill, will that be the case with Palantir? If it gets in the wrongs hands could that bring a deadly bane or if it gets into the good hands could that bring the greatest treasure?

kocj8m,Fulfilling my Ryan Gosling Big Short fantasy by throwing my life savings into DoorDash puts,"DoorDash is currently sitting at $142 per share, down 22% from $182 when retail investors were able to buy at IPO. Only \~10% of its 286M outstanding shares are available to trade due to its lockup period, giving it a float of 20M shares.

Here's where things get interesting. If you take a look at page 91 of their S-1 filing ([Go to page 91 to confirm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm#rom752207_9) ), existing shareholders PRE-IPO purchased 284M shares at $8.73. Company employees who purchased shares at that price are salivating at a current 1,628% profit. Early lockup period expires 90 days after IPO, meaning that 90% of outstanding shares (284M shares once again) that currently can't be traded and were purchased at $8.73 will be released into the market available to trade. Regardless of what you think about valuation and possible future growth of DoorDash (which is already ridiculously overpriced and they had the worst IPO in history), any rational employee will dump their holdings immediately for that 10 bagger profit.

Now considering present conditions, the price action is ridiculous. Looking at the level 2 data, there is almost no retail volume, and any trades made throughout the day are by MMs trying to keep this stock liquid. Volume from the past 2 days has already dropped by 50%. Literally NO ONE wants to buy this POS. The price is pinned at $140, with retail dips that are immediately bought up by manipulation. If you look at the 1 minute chart yesterday, it traded at literally $140 throughout the day and suddenly spiked to 146 in a manner of 3 minutes before slowly settling down to $142. This thing is manipulated as fuck, and as soon as MMs are exhausted it will crash regardless of the aforementioned S-1 filing.

I have 175 contracts of 5/21 $80 puts. I'm betting $87k I can look back at this post in 5 months and pretend I'm reenacting The Big Short as Ryan Gosling.

I added up all the individual awards and the costs as of the time starting there was 4990 awards. 

Turns out a total of 2,411,187 coins had been spent on awards, this equates to €6321.72 at the standard reddit price of €214.99 for 82000 coins. 

This could have been 335.5 shares of GME or 268.5 shares of Pltr at current prices.

kodguu,MY NEW YEARS RESOLUTION - Down 30K in Robinhood Account (and I know this post does not belong here),"  

**Options Trading Rules**

Always remember: **“Bulls Make Money, Bears Make Money,** **Pigs Get Slaughtered****!”**

1. Open and read these points before every trade you make.

2. Buy options that are no less than 4 weeks from expiring. Ideally, they would have at least 8 weeks until expiration or longer.

3. Buy calls or puts at the money or close to it. 

4. STOP JUMPING INTO STOCKS THAT YOU HAVE NOT MONITORED FOR AT LEAST 1-2 WEEKS.

a. This will give you an idea of what the stock is doing and the type of price action you are stepping into. 

b. If you miss out before entry, move on to another stock. They are plenty of stocks in the sea. 

5. Remember past events or trade outcomes will not determine how a new trade works out. If the stock is not going in the direction you thought it would GET OUT! Do not waste time wondering why and or going against what the price action is saying or doing. 

6. As much as you can, remove your emotions. Become a robot when it comes to trading. 

7. STOP CHASING THE MONEY YOU HAVE LOST!!!!!!!

8. STOP ALLOWING YOURSELF TO HAVE DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR. Its okay to dream just not in stock trading. Take profits when you can. It is okay if you make 5-10% in a trade before pulling the trigger. Not every trade will turn out to be 100% or 1000% return. 

9. Pay attention when Cramer pounds the table about a stock. Buy long dated Calls.

10. YOU NEED VOLUME for a stock to move. If the Volume is not there, move on or check again later.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kodguu/my_new_years_resolution_down_30k_in_robinhood/,bigpops850,1,1.0,2021-01-01 08:55:26,19,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kodguu/my_new_years_resolution_down_30k_in_robinhood/,DD,0

# Introduction

**Happy New Year!** **TL;DR- I am going to double a small account over a year, and you are going to watch.**

Three months ago I wrote up a guide on consistently outperforming the S&amp;P500 using Theta Gang strategy. That guide got a lot of positive feedback, and I suggest those who missed it take a look. [How to CONSISTENTLY Outperform the S&amp;P500 using Theta Gang Strategy. A Comprehensive Guide to Wheeling ETFs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iz68r4/how_to_consistently_outperform_the_sp500_using/) And if you are truly retarded check out my recent Tips for Noobies. [Top 5 Tips Every Noobie Trader MUST Know.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4ztif/top_5_tips_every_noobie_trader_must_know/)

I've since decided to put my skills to the test and will attempt to double a small $8000 account by the end of 2021 using similar strategies. This will mostly be an educational experience, and I will walk you through all my thought processes and my trades as I make them so hopefully the retards among you can learn a thing or two. And if I blow up the account, that will be entertaining as well, right?

Some of the less experienced among you may think this is a simple feat. The more experienced among you will know achieving such consistently high returns will be an incredibly difficult feat. I put my odds of success somewhere around 20% to be honest. But it will be a good education for both of us. Really, I only need to achieve around 6% return every month to break 100% by the end of the year (after compounding), and put in those terms the task doesn't sound so daunting, does it?

Still, I will be forced to make some very aggressive, downright risky plays in order to make this remotely possible. If my wheeling ETF guide was about a safe, conservative strategy, this guide will be the opposite. Keep that in mind if you are foolish enough to copy my trades. 

Wish me luck... I will need it.

# Basic Strategy

I will not leave any tool off the table here. If I see an opportunity, I will take it. But for the majority of my trades I will be using a very simple strategy. Find high implied volatility stonks and sell options on them. I will typically be selling cash-secured puts since naked calls carry excess risk, which means I want to look for stocks I am generally bullish on long-term.

Using ToS I've set up some very basic filters to scan for promising stocks to trade:

**1) Option Implied Volatility &gt;80% (for tendies)**

**2) Stock Volume &gt;5,000,000 (for liquidity)**

**3) Market Cap &gt;$1B (to comply with WSB rules)**

**4) Stock Price &lt;$82 (collateral maximum)**

Scanning with these filters brings up a lot of familiar names: GME, PLTR, QS, NKLA, LAZR, FCEL, UVXY, ACB, XPEV, SPCE, and so on. In other words, the type of stonks retards like you are buying expensive options on...

# Running the Numbers

I will try to not get too technical and into the weeds with this experiment. I'll be using some very basic math to decide which options to sell. I highly recommend you play around with the numbers on options to really get an intuitive feel for how they work. For example, if I were to ask you what happens to the relative cost of premium ($/day) as DTE increases on an option, what would be your answer? If you don't know, just run some simple numbers to find out...

SPY premium / DTE = $/day

332 / 5 = 66.4

440 / 10 = 44

652 / 21 = 31

1915 / 140 = 13.7

As you can see, premium cost per day decreases as time till expiration increases. (It's more complicated than that of course, but we are keeping it simple here). For that reason I will be doing something I generally don't advocate: Selling weeklies to squeeze a bit of extra juice out of my options. This also means I will be holding them all to expiration to deal with issues like higher gamma.

Here is another simple equation I can use to give me a lot of information:

**(Premium \* 365) / (DTE \* Strike) = Max ROI**

Basically what I'm doing is estimating the returns from selling the same option for an entire year with a 100% success rate. Since I'm aiming for 100% ROI, any options I sell will need to be over 100 in this formula. Of course, I won't have a 100% success rate on my trades, so I should probably aim even higher to give myself some buffer, maybe around 120. Let's try it on some \~ATM options to get a relative comparison of option value:

SPY: 12.2

PSTH: 48.1

GME: 140.5

PLTR: 111.1

QS: 263.7

UVXY: 134.2

Don't put too much stock in these numbers. I'm just using them as a simple comparative tool for judging the profitability of different options.

We can glean even more information from the above number if we multiply it by the Prob. ITM% of course, to get something closer to an ""Expected Value"" for an option, which I will perhaps go into more detail on next month.

Finally I'll be throwing around various other calculations as I go, $/day, ROI/month, premium/collateral, and so on. I will need to watch all of these and more to reach my goal.

# My First Trade

Looking at the stocks in my filter, there are two that really stand out to me: GME and PLTR. That's right, everyones favorite meme stocks!

GameStop is interesting as a short-term play, and has very high IV. But I'm not confident in the company as a long-term play, and would hate to be assigned hundreds of shares of that shitty brick and mortar hellscape. Palantir, on the other hand, has serious growth potential long-term and I would not mind being assigned. It has also been hit hard recently and is at a more reasonable entry level, which also makes it a good choice. **Therefore, I will be trading PLTR as my first play.**

I want to sell an OTM put to give myself some downside protection against a further drop, but not so far OTM that I can't break my 100% ROI goal. Let's plug some of the Jan. 15 options into my formula above to get a breakdown of the potential ROI.

21 strike: 74.2

22 strike: 108.4

22.5 strike: 131.9

23 strike: 155.5

Either the 22 or 22.5 strikes are right near the sweet spot we are looking for in terms of return. Of course conditions will likely change on Monday and I may need to reassess, but at the moment my current play seems to be:

**Sell to Open 3 contracts of PLTR 22p 1/15.**

If Monday opens red it will be even better for us, since we get in at a cheaper price with likely higher IV on top. So I for one am praying for a bloody Monday for Palantir (sorry bagholders).

Of course after selling 3 contracts at 22 strike, we will only have used $6600 of our $8000 capital. I may need to look for one more smallish trade on a stock in the $14 range to take full advantage of our capital. If GME drops on Monday we could consider a far OTM play there, for instance.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR- I am going to double a small account, and you are going to watch.**

I will update this post as plays are made, and will create a new post each month as a recap.

koezbj,GME Reality and Fantasy Prediction,"  GME is going to have a BIG week.
Here is why:

- RC plays like a chess grandmaster 
- 2 large buys on 12/30 (one intraday and one AH)
- 1st buy came just before RC’s tweets (mocking bears and warning that they are figuratively about to be burned alive in a house fire)
- Both large buys came in around the lows of the day
- QTR 4 in March will be a blowout
- Conference on Jan 8
- Probable release of holiday sales figures before conference
- Ridiculous % of shares sold short
- Hype on this stock is ratcheting up
- $600 stim checks are already in many of our accounts

How much more pain can the short sellers take? 

My crazy prediction/fantasy:

I think we go up 5% by 10 AM Monday,  Jan 4th. 

If a 13d comes out, we are looking at an immediate jump to $28 per share. From there, we go into a 3 day squeeze that will take us past $30 on day 1 (probably Tuesday Jan 5th by noon). On day 2 GME flys by $40, $50, $60, and momentarily hits $140 pps until it settles down around $80 pps by close on Day 3, which would be Thursday Jan 7th.

just on the same day. All were near the lows of the day.

RC felt antagonized. He already planned to buy shares, he did it yesterday, probably twice around $19 per share just on the same day. All were near the lows of the day.

RC felt antagonized. He already planned to buy shares, he did it yesterday, probably twice around $19 per share 
don’t see it going down this coming week. Stimulus checks are out. The hype for this stock is ratcheting up. Plus, RC is making more veiled threats via Twitter and mocking the bears. 

RC is playing this like a Chess Grandmaster. I’m predicting another 13d to come out this Monday or Tuesday around 10/11ish AM.

Again, all of this is probably just wishful thinking. But, it may come true.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/koezbj/gme_reality_and_fantasy_prediction/,caverypca,1,1.0,2021-01-01 10:21:00,139,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/koezbj/gme_reality_and_fantasy_prediction/,Discussion,0

kog1od,Wait a second... If Palantir is the first software to find a link between otherwise non connected variants of data. Then this means it is one of the first forms of creativity coming from AI.,"
I’ve been doing quite a bit of research on Palantir. There’s a few objectives for my research. 
1: To actually understand what it is.

2: To assess the long term growth potential.

3: To assess possible competition and how that could thwart market domination

Through all of this I became very excited initially. 

As this seems to be a free thinking pathway that can intermediate between pseudo “subconscious” types of data relationships that would be unexplored by 99% of other data platforms.

Then I became quite terrified, really. 
This data is being used by central governments for the most part and huge corporations.

This is the medium between the value of data and the implications of everything that could be done with the amounts of data with no stone left unturned.

Not all of it will be good, that can be assured.

https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/about

From Covid tracking to ICE deportations. Palantir has data on otherwise low data groups with not much of a digital footprint.

The thing is that people like you and I, who have a massive data footprint will be most susceptible to the ways it uses data over the next few decades.

While I’m still working on 2 and 3. I think my first question came with more questions than answers.

I’m long on Pltr 01/22cand 01/23c 

This is straight out of a comic book y’all.

If I’m going to be forced to indentured servitude I might as well have a few bucks in the bank as well. I’ll ride this baby to the top. 


Oh, and for those who fear the government might break it up, it won’t be regulated by the government.

The government will be regulated by PLTR.

kohoi8,GME the Silent Wealth Killer 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,"🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 GameStop 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Look over the list of stocks that have more than tripled in 2020 and GameStop has to jump out at you. GameStop? Really. The small-box video game retailer is one of this year's biggest winners despite wrapping up what will be its third consecutive fiscal year of declining sales. We're not buying physical games these days, and that's bad news for a model that relies on folks trading in their used games and gear for in-store credit.

We're kicking off a new console cycle, but hardware is always the lowest-margin business here. Once you score your PS5 you're not going to come back to GameStop for games the way you did in the past. GameStop used to be a cash-generating machine, but it's been three years since it turned an annual profit. The once beefy dividend was nixed two years ago.

A short squeeze has propped the stock higher, and the market's underestimating what a new console cycle will mean for GameStop. This game was over before it even started, and GameStop -- like DoorDash and SeaWorld -- will be a silent wealth killer in 2021.

kohyil,QuantumScape [Real DD],"**VW**

* **How did get tied up with QS?**
   * The VW CEO Martin Winterkorn son (also named Martin) works/worked for one of the QS Founder (Prof Prinz) at Stanford.
   * [http://npl-archive.stanford.edu/people/?m=134](http://npl-archive.stanford.edu/people/?m=134)
   * [http://npl-archive.stanford.edu/people/](http://npl-archive.stanford.edu/people/)
   * CEO Winterkorn resigned from VW (Dielgate) in  2015, but VW completed their first investment in QS in 2014 (and had a 'relationship' with QS since 2012 (according to the recent QS presentation))
* **Guess**: VW ""diesel-gate"" caused VW to bet bigger on clean-tech like QS, since they were already down the plan.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tech**

* **Prototype cell**:  Single-layer and 30 x 30 mm (1.1811 inch x 1.1811 inch)
   * The small size, which is quite far away from a commercial size cell makes be doubt if the results will scale to commercial size cells.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Lack of Energy Density Data**:  This is usually measured in Watt-hour/weight or Watt-hour/volume (Wh/kg or Wh/L).  QS shows a graph with their energy density at 1,000 Wh/L, but it wasn't backed up with any data, so it just looked like a goal.
   * Another point is that, when you have a 'solid' battery like QS, with no liquid electrolyte, you need  some additional materials to create the ionic conductivity between the anode and cathode (an anolyte and catholyte). No liquid electrolyte is good, since it reduces the ""explosivity"" of the battery.  But some in the industry think that, the need for an anolyte and catholyte, will cause the battery to have a lower energy density, and therefore not make economical sense.

&amp;#x200B;

*  **Solid State Separator (SSS**):  QS's main technical achievement is in the SSS, which separates the anode from the cathode.  Why hasn't anyone developed a good SSS yet?
   * **Perfect surface:**  The SSS needs to have perfect surface qualities.  If not, dendrites grow, and end up breaking through the SSS, and shorting out the anode and cathode (think of sticking a 2-prong fork into your electric outlet).
      * **Manufacturing Costs**: To create these perfect surfaces, requires technology more similar to semiconductor manufacturing than battery manufacturing equipment.  Semicon equipment is very expensive and doesn't have high-throughput (yes, when you're selling a &lt; 0.5"" square chip for $100+, it makes sense, but when you scale up to battery sizes, it doesn't make economical sense).
      * **Thin**: In order to keep energy density high the SSS needs to be thin, but the thinner it gets, the less strong it is.
      * **Fragile**: These thin and perfect SSS's are somewhat fragile, so in order to not degrade over the 100k mile life in a car, the battery pack needs to have more cushioning and other structures to make sure the SSS doesn't crack.   
      * **High Temperatures**:  SSS's conduct electricity best when they are warm 30C+.  This is why the main QS results are done at 30C and 45C.  Yes, QS shows some data at lower temperatures, but if QS's SSS worked well at lower temps, why weren't all the results shown at room temp (20F or 68F)?
      * Also needing equipment to warm up your batteries, takes up more battery-pack volume, therefore decreases the energy-density, and increase cost and complexity.

koit8n,Help Choosing my ETFs,"Hey guys I'm a pretty new investor, just started a month ago, up about 2k with a small initial investment of 5k, I've been moving most of my profits out of my robinhood and slowly building a schwab retirement account that I don't intend to touch for some decades, in this account, I'm focusing on dividends, tech, semiconductors and recently debating to invest in some ETFs for the long-term.

I really love to invest in tech, robotics, AI, renewable etc.

My choices (that I've found so far are ) MOON, HACK, BOTZ. If anybody has some insight on these or potentially some other ETFs that hover around these sectors I would be very grateful!

Shares play Bc overtime they will up div back to 3-4%. When that happens share price will be much higher 40-50. Buying shares now basically you are locking in a higher effective yield. 4% on 50 is 2 bucks every year. 2 bucks on original 30 dollar cost is 6.66% effective yield on your original share purchase. 

That’s why I like this. There’s a good chance you lock in 6-7% positive carry with even more upside for years, possibly decades. Dividend upping should happen in 2021 when fed allows banks to up dividend again...and div will keep growing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/koj361/you_guys_like_wfc/,ChimiChangas2020,1,1.0,2021-01-01 14:05:34,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/koj361/you_guys_like_wfc/,DD,0

koj731,How i ended up divorcing my wife because of WSB," From the time I was a child I dreamed my life would be a fairy tale - not a divorce story. I dreamed that I'd meet an amazing guy, find a great Job , and live happily ever after. But sometimes the path to that happy ending takes a few wicked turns along the way.

I thought the way to move ahead in life looked like this: do well in school, get into a great college, Understand Charts and Movements to day trade options, get married, have kids, and my reward for all of this would be to live with my love happily ever after. And it all started out that way...

I met my future wife shortly after I turned 19. she was a senior in the Chemical Engineering program and I was a freshman. To say we were smitten with each other is an understatement. i proposed 4 months after we met and she accepted without a second thought. 6 months later, we were hitched.

We moved a lot during the first few years, she never understood day trading more times then not bash me for not having a real job , and then we took a brake from society and went to sea . It took a toll on our marriage and we continued to grow apart over the years. As you can imagine, we were more roommates than spouses. We went to a marriage counselor, but it really didn’t help. We wanted different things and no amount of compromise on either of our parts would allow us to deny the inevitable: Her biggest pet Peeve was the lack of a job . Of course day trading in general isnt a ""job"" but i made joblike figures . She wanted a man that was ""handy"" and ""manly"" not some ""bum"" like me. The amount of money i made day trading was decent . Made 20k sense the beginning of the pandemic . But she hated how it wasn't a real job , she wanted to see a ""real Job"" how im not no Average man , im a pussy.

I felt tremendously guilty because I took my vows seriously; to me forever meant forever and I had broken that promise. I couldn’t sleep, my mind raced all night, and it led me down the path of anorexia. It was a very dark time for me.

But, luckily, I had friends and family who loved me and helped me see the light. Most of them had never been through divorce and didn’t really know how to help me, but they were always there whenever I reached out to them. I also worked with a therapist and took a divorce recovery class. Both helped me tremendously as I slowly found my way back to the land of the living. I was a newly singled woman and the rest of my life was right in front of me waiting for me to jump in and play. I really could continue creating my happily ever after instead of my life end with a tragic tale of divorce.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/koj731/how_i_ended_up_divorcing_my_wife_because_of_wsb/,Lucky-Designer3469,1,1.0,2021-01-01 14:11:14,78,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/koj731/how_i_ended_up_divorcing_my_wife_because_of_wsb/,Discussion,0

kojkmt,$BBBY Short squeeze plan,"Here is my take on $BBBY 6 days before their Q3 ER.

After a big change in management now led by Mark Tritton, $BBBY has managed to crawl back from the dead by shutting down numerous stores, selling the Cost Plus World Market and significantly improving the online shopping, which has played a large part in BBBY's success story.  All the company's debt has now been paid off and they have announced a large share buyback plan.

$BBBY managed to beat their Q2 estimate by $0,73 which resulted in $BBBY skyrocketing 70%. After that the stock has fallen 33% and has at the moment over 60% short float. 

All aforementioned information means that a large 🌈🐻 trap has been set and we are going to see a massive short-squeeze. Q3 earnings are supposed to be positive and are going to function as a catalyst to brutalize the bears. Combining it with the January effect, $BBBY has set its course to the Moon and the engines have been fired up.

Possible risks:
-$BBBY fell through its support line at $18 per share. There is a large gap to fill and although unlikely, the fall to $15 is not impossible.
-According to Yahhoo Finance $BBBY has formed a bearish Top Triangle pattern. A bullish Falling Wedge pattern has also taken form in 1 day chart but in my opinion patterns won't play a large role in this short-squeeze.
-Average analyst rating is 2,6. Who really cares tho.

TLDR:
-Possible short-squeeze incoming
-60% short float
-Q3 ER in 6 days, likely to beat the estimated earnings
-$BBBY has fallen almost 20% during December, great time to buy.
-Buy shares not options.
-Medium risk - High reward",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kojkmt/bbby_short_squeeze_plan/,FrogoftheNorth,1,1.0,2021-01-01 14:31:36,22,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kojkmt/bbby_short_squeeze_plan/,DD,0

kok5vy,FDX 8Jan weeklies for discussion,"What do you degens think of FDX weeklies for next week?  8jan near the money calls?

stock has taken a hit since earnings where they beat both top and bottom line.  sure they did not give guidance but they have traditionally been conservative in forward performance.  couple of upgrades this past week as well and looks to have bottomed per the daily.

price hit a tested support level of roughly 258ish on 31Dec. this level was tested and held a couple of times since late Oct.

weeklies are cheap, sub 30 IV.  On verge of being oversold.

problem is i could see this stock going sideways for a bit, not much conviction out there... that i know of.  lacks a vol squeeze which i like to target.

kokf03,TSLA Future Model Lineup You S3XY B1TCH(ES)🚀 🚀 🚀,"Papa Elon is playing some serious big brain games with us smooth brains. The current Tesla lineup has been released chronologically such that it spells out the word “sexy”. First came the model S, then the 3, then X, and finally Y. Put them all together in that exact order and you get “S3XY”. This was no mistake and Elon is 69 steps ahead of every single one of us. 

Elon isn’t going to stop there and will continue his message to us and assert his god tier status by releasing the next five consumer vehicles with the models named B, 1, T, C, and H. In that exact order to give us “B1TCH” when put together. Put all nine vehicles in order the way they were released and you get “S3XY B1TCH”. Yes Elon, you are the sexiest bitch of them all. 

TL;DR: Elon is a sexy bitch taking us to Mars 🚀.

Positions: Long shares. Waiting for a dip to drop my nuts on calls. If my wife’s bf would increase my allowance I could buy some TSLA 6/18 800c.

*Processing img t99m4y35ys861...*

**PSTH is Bill Spackman's Baby Baby....**

It cannot fail. It has great financials with no debt and over $7B in free cash flow. Returns over the last 10 years have been higher than 20% each year. I have held this stock for over 10 years and the dividends are funny fun fun tendie time wowie.

The warrant structure ""TONTINE"" is fun for all the boys and girls.

***TONTINE: For every 9 common share you buy and hold through the merger you get an additional 1000 shares at $2.00! WOW! BIG SAVINGS.***

If a deal isn't struck, that is a-OKAY! You get free money! For every 9 shares that you own and if Ackman fails, you get $500 gift card for Herbalife Nutrition. Ha! Not gunna happen!

Its the greatest single company that ever did exist.

If you buy tomorrow at $29 you are getting in earlier.

This thing is going to $750 by mid-week next week.

Ackman has already announced a 200:1 stock split meaning the stock will trade from 750 to $3.75. That means a lot for you! You can buy it for 3 bucks! Great. Really bigly great.

If the mods don't pin this, that would be egregious!

Double your money! Buy PSTH!

komelh,GME careers as a reflection of their roadmap,"I always find interesting how companies' available jobs could hint at the future state of the execution of their roadmap. In the case of $gme you can find a few interesting things to observe:

\- eCommerce investments (keyword Omnichannel): [https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?facetcategory=ecommerce](https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?facetcategory=ecommerce) . Although it is in my opinion a very poor initial effort (only 2 job postings), it could be the start of the effort to hire the core leadership team first.

\- Technology: [https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?facetcategory=information%20technology%2Fecommerce%20technology](https://careers.gamestop.com/en-US/search?facetcategory=information%20technology%2Fecommerce%20technology) . As can be seen here (also only 2 job postings).

It is clear that $gme lacks the engineering caliber to execute RC's vision and the board; as of today, is not quite showing that they are taking the necessary steps to pursue reinventing the business. Looking forward to the upcoming events and announcements in 2021 Q1 and Q2.

komxj9,Potential in coming real estate dip in 2021. Are there any non-idiots among us that work in this space and want to share their thoughts?,"TLDR: I have no fucking clue what I am talking about. It looks like the housing market is ready to decline in late 2021, maybe as soon as the spring. I am considering selling my rental house soon... obviously so I can yolo more into GME, PLTR, and SPCE - I can't help myself and I don't want help. If this happens, REITs might dip further, making for a nice entry point.

&amp;#x200B;

Home prices have been steadily rising the last five or so years to the point  we are seeing a spike in the inflation adjusted housing costs. It looks  like we are at the 07/08 highs again.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r6on75066t861.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bac32713ff598bab5431b52ae7d8e45332340ba

I have been following the forbearance rates since covid started, and it looks like many of the national lenders have forbearance rates in the 3-6% range, still.  Historically these are under 1% for all lenders. If these eventually  turn into delinquencies after the forbearance period expires and covid  eviction protections expire, I am worried we might see a surge in  foreclosures and thus a flood of cheap real estate hitting the market, thus drastically reducing home prices in the second half of 2021.

I'll  walk you through the timing I am seeing. 

* The majority of forbearance  requests were made in March - June (the MBA has been publishing this  data). 
* These periods usually last 180 days,  based on historical forbearance periods. 
* And I believe these periods can  be extended for up to one year, which is also part of covid relief.
* The  national average number of delinquent payments on a mortgage before  foreclosure is about four.
* For those with 180 day forbearance periods started in March- June of 2020, it looks like this: 6 months forbearance + 4 months delinquency = 10 months, which puts these foreclosures on the market in February 2021-May 2021.
* For those with 365 day forbearance periods started in March- June of 2020, it looks like this: 12 months forbearance + 4 months delinquency = 16 months, which puts these foreclosures on the market in July 2021- October 2021.
* Finally, for those who were delinquent prior to covid, and would have been evicted during covid, the eviction protection has prevented banks from foreclosing, so these homes will hit the market in February 2021, after the eviction protections expire on January 31st 2021. Foreclosures are down 80% this year because of this.

&amp;#x200B;

If  we check FRED and look at delinquent payment on real estate over the  last 20 years, we can see about 10% of homes and real estate were in delinquency by 2010 (below). If all the current forbearances turn into  delinquent payments, which turn into foreclosures, we could see a 2-6%  spike by the end of the summer, or a 2-6x increase in foreclosure  based real estate hitting the market. Plus we need to add in the 80% of foreclosures that will hit post eviction moratorium. That would be about 2/3s the delinquency rate we saw post financial crisis, which would could cause quite a dip in home prices.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 5rr035o96t861...*

The current market is also further magnified buy the shortage of homes for sale, in part due to the lack of foreclosures due to the eviction moratorium. You can see below, the US is at an all time low for monthly supply  of houses, dating back to 1960.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4136uv3c6t861.png?width=1174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=859c31a721b63b5c01f787d6cfec5ae387a8700e

When you combine a low supply with a relatively high demand (see housing  sales the last two years, below), this creates a pretty expensive market based  on supply and demand. Also, interest rates are low, so people can afford more, so housing prices are higher as a result.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/abfzz0he6t861.png?width=1179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd698a8aefca84c6318c3c74da02ec2293b7aa19

In agreement with this, home prices are the highest in history as well  (below), even when adjusted for inflation (first figure of the post).

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img nhdsp7bh6t861...*

&amp;#x200B;

This could easily turn  into a serious situation in which a sudden spike in foreclosures and  cheap real estate could cascade into a pretty swift crash, and  significantly reduce the value of real estate around the country by a  huge margin.

Does  anyone here have any real expertise on this matter? I am a complete  newb and idiot. I don't know what I am doing, I am just speculating. I  would greatly appreciate an expert's opinion on the matter.

kon4gq,DD - Digital Marketing,"Ladies, Gentleman, 🌈🐻's, and random OnlyFans hoes I see on here always begging for money, here is my first attempt at DD in this god forsaken sub. Unfortunately, I left my TA crayons at home, so I'll try to indent and tab over my walls of text as much as possible so that you Zoomers can pay attention to at least 1/4 of it.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*I do want to clarify that some of the timing of iOS 14 changes could get changed and Facebook could push back against certain parts of the change. I did my best to explain the basics of what I think is going on, but it is possible that I miscommunicated or misunderstood some parts of the iOS 14 update, so digital marketers, feel free to let me know in the comments and I'll edit accordingly\*\*\*

\-------------------------------

# TL;DR - Apple's iOS 14 - ""Get Zucked, Zuckerberg,"" Said Tim Cook

For reasons that will be explained below, it is possible that Google and Facebook will begin seeing their duopoly slowly diminish over the next several years (probably &gt;7 years, based on how ""fast"" Turtle Mitch is able to get anything done). I do believe that Google and Facebook will continue to be the top two players in the game for the foreseeable future **(SO I AM NOT RECOMMENDING SHORTING THESE AT ALL YOU 🌈 NOOBS).** 

The core problems that these companies will soon face, especially Facebook, is [anti-trust law suits from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization), more distrust of their platform due to the most recent election, censorship across both platforms, a complete failure of Facebook to properly address the negative side effects of social media on the youth and actually do something about it, and, most importantly, **Apple upgrading to iOS 14 (explained more later).** 

* [The Anti-Trust Law Suit from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization) talks about Facebook becoming a monopoly and buying all the competition such as Instagram and WhatsApp, instead of competing against them.
* [iOS 14](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2020/08/30/ios-14-facebooks-apple-nightmare-keeps-getting-worse/?sh=3029be574cfe) update will roll out early 2021. This will hinder the collection of iPhone identifiers for advertisers ([IDFA](https://www.appsflyer.com/mobile-attribution-glossary/idfa/)), one of the primary things used to track users online.

\-------------------------------

Primary Issues For Facebook From The iOS 14 Update

1. &gt;!Bidding Issues:!&lt; As I stated above, Facebook is going to lose more and more data points as  time goes on, making it so that they aren't able to bid appropriately on someone like Johnny Bravo when he is scrolling through his insta feed. What does this mean? Insta may look at Johnny Bravo as a Joe Schmo and decide that he's not worth bidding up on, so Johnny Bravo will never see those ads of Playboy and Whey Protein that he would have bought if he got an ad for it. (Example for this: with the iOS14 update, Facebook loses its data points to Johnny Bravo's workout apps, so they had no way of knowing he would have been more likely to convert.
2. &gt;!Creating Audiences:!&lt;Facebook is going to lose thousands of data points on its users, effectively making it harder to match these audiences into their appropriate buckets. Before, if someone had several golf apps on their phone, you could assume they were a golf lover more easily. Without being able to use that app data sharing, it will be much harder to know they like golf unless they follow several golfing pros / shows in Facebook.

\-------------------------------

With the expectation that Facebook will become less efficient as time goes on and that certain lawsuits could negatively affect the company, many advertisers are looking for other viable options to put their ad dollars. There have been several social media competitors working to monetize their app and become the third wheel of digital marketing. Some of these companies include:  


* PINS - Pinterest 🚀🚀🚀
* SNAP - Snapchat 🚀
* TWTR - Twitter 🚀
* Twitch - (Owned by Amazon aka AMZN) 🚀🚀
* LNKD - LinkedIn (Owned by Microsoft aka MSFT) 🚀
* Hulu Ads - (Owned by Disney aka DIS) 🚀🚀
* TikTok - Not sure if correct, but you may be able to get shares [here](https://www.ig.com/en/shares/ipos/bytedance-tiktok-ipo) (ticker tbd, but pretty sure it will be ZOOMR 🚀

The name of the game is trying figuring out which of these new channels will be the next to gain 5-10% more market share of ad spend from clients and which will be nothing more than moneyless pits since they do a terrible job at monetizing their app and creating engaging ads that lead to conversions for clients (looking at you SNAP and TikTok).

\-------------------------------

MY RECENT BACKGROUND (aka why should you even bother listening to this autist):

* **Worked in digital marketing and finance for the last 5 years**, also took on several side jobs doing digital marketing for companies
   * **I managed &gt;$10 million in ad spend across various digital marketing channels (Google/Bing/Facebook/Shopping) over the last 30 days** and over &gt;$40 million in ad spend over the last year
   * I work with a team of Managers and Directors at my agency to help talk about new opportunities and keep up with digital marketing trends across all channels
   * Using our &gt;300 clients data, our company is able to look at macro trends at a faster rate, so we can quickly identify which new channels to focus our efforts in (Pinterest/TikTok/Snap/Twitch/etc.)
      * This was highlighted over the last year or year and a half when we noticed a huge spike in companies using Pinterest as a primary channel for digital marketing. Only more and more companies are going to join into the race, this is just the beginning.

\-------------------------------

# Any of these stocks or multiple could improve throughout the following years, but my money is on PINS 🚀🚀🚀

* Even with PINS recent run up in stock price, I think there is still plenty of time to buy this stock now.
   *  Our clients are continuing to spend more and more on the Pinterest ad platform and it is returning better performance metrics (ROAS/ROI) than most of the other mentioned channels. 
* Pinterest also relies on on targeting people based on boards they visit/follow/create, combined with using a search query method for ads, somewhat similar to Google's. **This means they don't have to rely as much on pixel data, like Facebook does, to create their audience targeting.**

&amp;#x200B;

# I think the safest way to make money on PINS is to buy stocks for the long term, but I know that doesn't get some of your little schlongs hard enough. 

* Their next earnings are on 2/4/21(after hours) and ***I fully expect them to smash expectations just like McConnell's dad smashed that turtle to give birth to Mitch.*** 
   * Look at PINS options that make sense to you for a little after earnings, preferably not 2/5, literally the day after earnings. But you do you boo.

Okay, since you know that I'm obsessed and literally Can't Stop, Won't Stop, GameStop! ... Here's a 4Q20 model update to kick off 2021 as we start to gather up our popcorn for the ICR Conference festivities in just 10 days ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kknuk6/gme\_icr\_conference\_words\_matter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kknuk6/gme_icr_conference_words_matter/))

For those that have big brains and have been following along (here's the most recent one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh9na8/gme\_4q20\_financial\_model/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kh9na8/gme_4q20_financial_model/)), I have ticked almost every metric down, with the largest reduction being a 4k+ trim to daily order rate as January/post Christmas has started off rather weak. It's irrefutable that supply, whether through managerial operational failings, or lost market share, or outside their control due to Covid, is weighing on sales. Whenever there's been console supply especially the uptick in sales is notable and somewhat durable in the order rate data (many thanks once again GME Gang for the steady influx of [GameStop.com](https://GameStop.com) order #s!!! You retarded motherfuckers are going to singlehandedly pump the PowerUp Rewards loyalty numbers 😂  ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/km26gn/gamestop\_dd\_and\_potential\_profits/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/km26gn/gamestop_dd_and_potential_profits/))

With two full months of the quarter gone by I would note no one should have ever put their belief solely into one quarter making/breaking their thesis in isolation (unless you're talking about a biotech or some crazy shit. But this is a goddamn [GameStop.com](https://GameStop.com), FKA GameStop, we're talking about here.). The bears will vociferously argue otherwise. I look forward to hearing the gnashing of teeth of the dying animal that is Melvin Capital &amp; co. Let's make 'em bleed, boys.

My base case sits at $2/share, and will likely come down a touch more barring incremental console supply in January (in base case).

koonr3,I think WSB is sleeping on a huge opportunity in Apple this month. Here’s why.,"**TLDR:** Due to a confluence of factors (none of which are technical analysis), I believe a perfect storm is likely forming for a monster, historic ER occurring sometime in late January. The initial main factor for this was that COVID issues were causing a delay in the iPhone 12 launch, pushing it into to this quarter, but that led me to discover numerous other factors now making up my thesis. I believe not only will earnings grow, but the multiple could even expand. How to play it: calls dated end of Jan or mid Feb.    
    
# Analysis:    
Happy hangover day, fellow autists. I believe opportunities are rare to know when an ER is going to blow it out of the water by enough to overcome IV crush based on more than just a hunch, and when they occur once or twice per year you should swing big. When I play earnings releases, I’m almost always just a seller of spreads so that I can profit off of theta/IV crush surrounding the ER (theta gang always wins). This time however, I’ve bought outright calls. Here is what I’m seeing with Apple: 
    
## The iPhone 12 delay could mean huge YoY comparisons.    
What kicked all this off was that two months ago I realized we could be heading for huge numbers this quarter do to an atypical delay in the launch of the newest iPhone. Typically new iPhones are announced in mid-September with preorders beginning immediately and shipments beginning before the end of the month. However this year because of COIVD delays the launch date got pushed into October. The iPhone 12 preorders began mid-October with shipments a week later, and the iPhone 12 mini and Max began preorders November 6. And that means no sales of the new models counted in the quarter ended Sept. 30 (Apple’s fiscal fourth quarter)as they usually do. This year all of those opening day sales have fallen into the upcoming fiscal Q1, setting up a potentially huge quarter in sales and making for easy YoY comparisons right out of the gate.  [Here’s a Fortune article on the delay of the launch.](https://fortune.com/2020/10/29/apple-q4-2020-earnings-delayed-iphone-12-sales/)    
    
## The “super cycle” rumors appear to be true.    
As a lover of new tech, I always have to remind myself that the average person doesn’t care about incremental new features as much as I do. So when I heard rumors earlier this year that Apple could be facing a “super cycle” of upgrades due to 5G, I was skeptical. How much does the average person really care about spotty 5G service enough to jump on a new iPhone? But based on reports starting to come out, those rumors appear to be correct. I’ve seen a few articles suggesting a super cycle not seen since the iPhone 6.     
    
[Here’s a Yahoo Finance article on Wedbush’s analysis](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wedbush-apple-aapl-iphone-12-141113883.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACvsQ8XuWl-EktMyc_0BOQkervx-N2812THmBzr26X8EZIBpNv2lmQ5FSlcToQD1EVRPC0q6byIRBL57FjX5kL4yCvJbv0rwaj4D16cz9J0QrnLFX9fVib7fRoDktDyMAWwBKhfTL_JRqy04wsJCzfTUD7Aw9ce6SkM21ZQOqbYO).   
    
Here are some notable quotes from that article since I know we don’t read around here.    
&gt;""Based on our recent Asia checks we believe the supply chain is anticipating low to mid 90 million iPhone unit builds … **a roughly 35% increase from our original and Street forecasts**,"" says Ives, who covers AAPL stock for Wedbush.    
    
&gt;Compare that to the firm's expectations for iPhone 12 unit sales over time. Three months ago, Wedbush expected 65 million to 70 million unit builds for the December quarter; it raised its outlook to 75 million units in late October; and in mid-December, it set a ""stretch goal"" in the mid-80 million range.    
    
&gt;Wall Street broadly sees AAPL selling 217 million iPhones in the company's fiscal 2021, but Wedbush's bull case is ""north of 240 million units (250 million could be in the cards – an eye popping figure)"" that would easily surpass the 231 million units the company sold in its fiscal 2015.    
    
&gt;**""We have not seen a launch uptrend such as this in a number of years for Apple and the only iPhone trajectory similar would be the iPhone 6 in 2014 based on our analysis.""**.   
    
[Here is an AppleInsider article, although it quotes the same research at Wedbush](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/15/apple-iphone-production-reports-corroborate-supercycle-thesis-analyst-says).   
Notable quote:    
&gt; That bump in production would represent a 30% year-over-year increase in smartphone models produced, **and is also well ahead of current Wall Street expectations**, Ives wrote.    
    
    
It’s anecdotal, but I personally skipped the iPhone 11 upgrade because I was perfectly content with my XS Max, however I did buy the 12 Pro Max.    
    
## The iPhone 12 sales mix:   
It’s not just that phone sales will be up on the iphone 12 launch, it’s the mix within those sales. Typically when Apple launches phones they sell more of the of the entry level new phones than they do the premium, because the total addressable market is bigger. That doesn’t appear to be the case this time. As early as September people were reporting that [Apple was making more higher end iPhone 12 models than entry-level handsets](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-stock-gets-price-target-hike-iphone-12-sales-mix) anticipating a shift in demand, and they appear to have been correct. Last year the entry level iPhone 11s outsold the premium iPhone 11s by a three to one margin. This year almost immediately after launch [people were reporting that the premium iPhone 12s were selling as much as the entry models.](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/greater-than-expected-iphone-12-demand-apple-aapl-stock-buy/) Since then, there have been reports trickling out that the premium iPhone 12s appear to actually be outselling the entry level versions.   
    
## Apple sold out of nearly everything they make for Christmas.
See further below for one of the reasons this may have happened, in both my “macro” and “risks” sections.    
    
    

Apple introduced a slough of new products from iMacs to watches this year, and they sold out of all of them. **The list of sold-out products at Christmas included the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max; iPad, iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad Mini; MacBook Air and Pro; iMac and iMac Pro; HomePod mini, and AirPods Max.** [Here’s a Barron’s article mentioning the sell outs](https://www.barrons.com/articles/barrons-10-best-stocks-for-2021-51608337138).    

    
    
Apple wearables, I would argue, are now what economists call Veblen goods. These are unique products where the demand curve actually increases as the price increases. This can happen in goods such as wine, where the consumer lacks the knowledge in how to evaluate the product so they take pricing as a signal of quality. But another reason you can get that skewed demand curve is if the product conveys status. One example of this is sports cars. You can buy cars with 90% of the performance of the ultra top end cars for 30% of the price, but that’s not the point of owning them, is it? How often are you really out at the track? Lambo isn’t in competition with $50k sports cars. They could raise the price $50k per car and people who can afford them would just want them more. Louis Vuitton bags and $50,000 Birkin purses are more examples. In fact with Birkin they not only constantly raise prices, they forbid people from buying them. You have to spend a lot of money on other lower tier products before you’re “allowed” to even buy a Birkin bag. This just makes new money women want them even more. 
   

Those are dramatic examples of course and Apple isn’t behaving that way, but Apple just introduced very overpriced, new over-the-ear headphones which cost almost twice as much as the leading competitor, and yet...Apple sold out of every single color in the first two weeks and hit a three month waiting list by Christmas on a product that I would assume due to its high pricing has very fat margins. Apple charging twice as much makes them more appealing, not less, because wearables are worn and thus seen by your peers (and the opposite sex).   
    
## The Twitter rumor mill is reporting parts moving at a brisk pace
I can’t track down the things I’ve read here and there on Twitter and I’m starting to run out of steam here, so you may have to do some searching on your own, but people who usually track movement of parts through the companies forming Apple’s supply chain and normally have a good track record with their reports have reported that parts are moving through the chain at a very brisk pace. This is addressed some in the reports on the iPhone supply chain in my earlier links.    
    
## App sales are crushing it.   
Thanks probably in part to quarantine, app sales have been crushing it and [grew ~35% this December compared to ~17%](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-alphabet-strong-christmas-sales) the prior year, meaning sales have grown at twice the pace.     

## Reoccurring revenue bundle numbers will be announced     
The biggest thing I’ve learned from 2020 is that nothing matters more to the market than the narrative surrounding the reoccurring revenue bundle...aka subscriptions. A company announces its cutting its dividend, but then tells you that’s because its going to pour all that money into boosting its subscriptions? The stock skyrockets. Look at Disney. AT&amp;T may be able to pull this off as well if it can convince people of that narrative with Warner/HBO max and cut its dividend to pour it into content, but that’s a big “if” for them.    
    
Apple launched their new reoccurring revenue bundle this year. I personally signed up for the premium tier and now owe Apple $30 per month for the rest of my life. I was already paying them to backup my phone to the cloud, and now their bundle has thrown me into Apple Music, Apple TV+, etc. I am firmly entrenched in the Apple universe whether I like it or not.     
    
It is these reoccurring revenue numbers that offer the possibility of earnings multiple expansion.
    
# RISKS
**Are sellouts due to high demand, or due to COVID-related production problems?**    
I don’t know.  Based on the reports I’ve read, some of which have been linked earlier in my post, it sounds like everything is running full speed in China and the supply chain is running at near or above a record clip. One possible risk is that this was not the case earlier this year and thus Apple sold out of things because they hadn’t produced enough heading into Christmas. I personally believe that production may have taken a huge hit early in the calendar year, but by mid to late 2020 this was no longer a significant issue. I also believe that even if sales have taken a slight hit due to production, the market wouldn’t really care. Markets are forward looking. They know COVID has impacted things globally, and even if Apple reports sales difficulties **they will be paired with significantly increased guidance for Q2**. [New reports have suggested that Apple has had to increase its iPhone production plans for 2021 by 20-30% because of strong demand}.(https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/15/strong-iphone-12-demand/) An announcement like that is not a recipe for a stock crash.     
    
    

**Macro factors causing a crash**.    
A lot of people around here appear to be scared of an impending crash. This seems to be based on the simple idea that stocks have run up a lot and therefore must crash. A reversion to the mean is imminent. I don’t see it that way and I think the economy is more complex than that. Just because something has gone up a lot does not mean it’s going to crash. People have been warning of a California real estate crash for 70 years.    
    

I’m a little bit older than you guys (by probably about 10-15 years) and I can remember the market frenzy of the dot.com boom. A lot of people were saying the same thing then, and while they were ultimately proven right, they were very early. I remember seeing another year to year and a half of enormous gains after hearing all those warnings. Of course the problem with musical chairs is that we never know when the music will stop, but I would argue if anything stocks are roughly fairly valued, not dangerously overvalued.    
    
As we go into 2021, we face the following conditions: a vaccine roll out that sometime between now and late ‘21 will lead us into a v-shaped recovery. [The Krugman argument for this vision](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/opinion/joe-biden-economy.html), and [The Bloomberg argument for this vision](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/opinion/articles/2020-12-01/get-ready-for-a-supercharged-economy). We also just had the Fed reaffirm 0% interest rates and the continuation of QE. Add to all of that very easy YoY earnings comps for the first two quarters of this year and this is not a recipe for a crash, it’s a recipe for a steady market melt up. Where are the rich supposed to put all their money in a 0% interest rate environment? 0% pushes up the value of all asset classes, and this is especially true of real estate and stonks. Generally speaking, predicting macro economic movements is a losing game, but all of those things combined with the easy YoY comps means I don’t feel the need to be concerned of an impending correction for at least the next two quarters. 
    
A much smaller factor but still a factor, I have seen it suggested that Apple will be among the larger beneficiaries of the stimulus checks going out, although those have not started rolling out until just now so that may have an impact on Q2 if any.

**Bad subscription numbers**    

If subscriptions to Apple One flopped, this could significantly overshadow sales and earnings numbers. I personally feel Apple isn’t likely to seriously miscalculate predictions on a subscription bundle because they have their market dialed in, but I don’t know that for sure. 

**Sales could have cratered in October**    

Sales often drop a little in the weeks preceding a phone launch. What if phone sales tanked during the delays waiting for an iPhone 12? That could be bad. I’m encouraged by the fact that iPhone 11 models appeared to still be having good sales numbers when the iPhone 12 was launched (see links earlier in this post), but I don’t really know what October sales look like.

**COVID could have tanked all phone sales.**    

[This report says all phone activations generally tanked 23% on Christmas Day.](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-iphones-dominate-christmas-day-activations) Two thoughts I have on that, that number is for all phone activations, not just iPhones. And two, that’s just for Christmas Day itself. There could be a wide array of reasons activations were down on that one day. To counter that, [this report says the iPhone was the best selling 5G phone](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/21/best-selling-5g-phone/), even in October despite the phone not launching until the second half of that month. Additionally that article mentions pent up demand for 5G apple phones that sales are likely to be strong going forward.

##  Technical Analysis   
I don’t believe in technical analysis. Charts don’t know any of the things I just explained, and are therefore, in my opinion, useless to me. Maybe somebody has figured out a system for charts to predict the future, but I am not that person. 

## Fun rumors    
I’m not big on speculative rumors and momentum type plays, but if that’s your thing there are certainly rumors in the air. The most famous of which is the rumor that Apple is back to working seriously on an EV Car. Another is reports are just coming out in the last day or two that [Apple is seeing new successes in developing foldable tech.](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/31/two-foldable-iphones-reportedly-pass-tests/) Whether these things will impact the stock price isn’t really my cup of tea, but if it’s yours those are two things to consider. 

## Is my post an attempt at a WSB pump and dump?    
I’m under no allusions that my own WSB post is going to alter the trajectory of a $2.25 trillion company in any meaningful way.  That sort of thing may work on a post-IPO company that hasn’t had its lockup expiration yet and thus has a tiny float (aka PLTR or numerous other recent “to the moon” meme stocks) with limited float. (That’s not to say those aren’t great companies or great trades. I’m just sayin’).


## My positions: 
I’m more conservative than most of WSB.  While I love this place with all my heart and love you guys for it, I believe risking it all to chase screenshot-worthy gains is moronic and not the path to building real, long-term wealth. Thus my positions are probably more conservative than you’d expect.    
    
I have 20% of my net worth tied up in Apple via LEAPs. 9/16/2022 APPL $87.50 calls. I consider this to be essentially stock I hold for the long term. Delta is approaching 1 anyway so they practically are stock. Sometime in the depths of March I loaded up on FAANG LEAPs with the intention of actually holding them for years and then converting to shares. Those LEAPs were a little OTM at the time I bought them. I have no interest in day trading my significant LEAP positions so that’s going to sit there for the next two years.

But I also have put an additional 15% of my net worth into short term calls on Apple to play the ER. I have Feb 19 $130 calls which were about 10-15% OTM at the time I bought them. They are currently ITM. I also have 1/29 $135s and 1/29 $141s.     
    
This puts 35% of my net worth into Apple.

## How to get rich
I intend to cash out my short term calls after the ER, and I don’t intend to reinvest or roll them out because I suspect Apple will be fully valued by then and there are better plays out there. I intend to keep my LEAPS because I bought those for the very long term and because at the very least I should hold them until March to hit the long term capital gains tax rate.    
    
I intend to take my profits from the calls and push them into shorting NNOX and XPEV, both of which have significant lockup expirations coming in mid to late February which I believe will significantly impact the stock prices in the short term. I have no interest in shorting XPEV right now, because you guys are crazy as fuck and for all I know EV stonks could all run up another 50% in the next month. Right about the time the Apple ER hits should be perfect.

## Criticism    
If you think I’m wrong, I would strongly encourage you to comment. I don’t give a fuck about looking correct or saving face but I give many fucks about not losing money. If I’m wrong, I want to know it.

&gt;1. Tesla has no “moat” of any kind; i.e., nothing meaningfully proprietary in terms of electric car technology, while existing automakers—*unlike* Tesla­—have a decades-long “experience moat” of knowing how to mass-produce, distribute and service high-quality cars consistently and profitably, as well as the ability to subsidize losses on electric cars with profits from their conventional cars.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. Excluding sunsetting emission credit sales and adjusted for its fraudulently low warranty reserve (see below), in 2020 Tesla will again lose money, as it has every year in its 17-year existence.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. Unit demand for Tesla’s cars is only increasing via continual price cutting.  
&gt;  
&gt;4. [Elon Musk is a pathological liar who under the terms of his SEC settlement cannot deny having committed securities fraud](https://www.plainsite.org/realitycheck/tsla.pdf).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; **Nothing is more amusing than seeing this giant stock promotion of a company try to perpetuate the illusion of being “supply constrained” by continuing to add capacity (expanding its Chinese factory while breaking ground on new factories in Texas and Germany) in order to desperately try to maintain an image of “limitless demand” while it continually slashes prices just to utilize far less than its existing capacity. Tesla’s “plan” is now obvious: keep slashing prices to move as much volume as possible while using the world’s most illicitly creative accounting to maintain razor-thin profitability. But what’s the end game? If Tesla stops cutting prices volume will collapse. Tesla is no longer “a growth story”—it’s a nearly-profitless stock promotion for idiots!**

koqieb,Something to feed your confirmation bias on Nio,"Nio's expansion to Europe has been discussed a lot. Many expressed doubts that Europeans would buy a Chinese car given all the negative stereotypes. From 2021, Germany introduced a CO2 tax (7c per liter) and till 2025 they give 9000 Euros for purchasing a EV. My main problem with German EVs is that they have an abysmal range. VW promises something up to 220km. I drove BMW i3 and whatever they promise there, the truth is that it's around 170 km and the charging takes like 9 hours. Why the hell do I need a car with such a range? 

Nio offers a range up to 900 km. Wow. That's something to consider. But what about the Chinese quality and as a potential German customer who got screwed over by the government's CO2 tax right on the New Year's day I decided to google what German reviews say on Nio:

ADAC praises Nio quality and price, specifying that 70% of materials are from renowned producers like Bosch

https://www.adac.de/rund-ums-fahrzeug/autokatalog/marken-modelle/auto/nio-es6/

Another very positive review stating that it has some problems with being adjusted to the European standards and market but in general it's a good car for German roads and is much cheaper than a comparable Audi

https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/fahrbericht/nio-es6-guenstiger-elektro-suv/

Another generally positive review. They point out that the battery is not suitable for a speed of over 120km/h which is a big problem for Germany's autobahn as 120 km/h is the annoying grandma speed here. However, other European countries have a speed limit so it might be less of a problem

https://www.autobild.de/artikel/nio-es6-performance-2022-test-preis-deutschland-reichweite-technische-daten-elekrtro-suv-17098037.html

Tl;dr German reviewers praise Nio for its price, quality and driving experience. The main disadvantage is that it is not fulfilling for some Europe-specific demands. However, if Nio adapts to those requirements, it will be a recommendable car.

Tl;dr for retards: Nio at the European market 🚀🚀🚀",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/koqieb/something_to_feed_your_confirmation_bias_on_nio/,not_kathrine,1,1.0,2021-01-01 21:12:57,97,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/koqieb/something_to_feed_your_confirmation_bias_on_nio/,DD,0

**Dec 17, 2020** \- Bill Ackman follows SpaceX on Twitter (For enthusiast of Yolo style DD)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PSTH/comments/ke2jrx/bills\_just\_trying\_to\_troll\_us\_now/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSTH/comments/ke2jrx/bills_just_trying_to_troll_us_now/) 

**Analysis:**

In 2018 Musky needs $10 billion to complete Starlink's global constellation. By 2019 SpaceX had filed for 42,000 satellites but are accused of trying “to drown the ITU in studies so they can go ahead and operate Starlink under FCC sharing rules while ignoring the ITU first to file rules” ([https://twitter.com/TMFAssociates/status/1183436364974419968](https://twitter.com/TMFAssociates/status/1183436364974419968)) At this point I believe that funding methods were being discussed and the possibility of a Starlink spin off was proposed. 

February 6, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell expresses this sentiment at the JP Morgan event. I think it was still only speculative and Musk would basically refute this March 9 at the Satellite 2020 conference saying he was thinking about it “zero”. In August SpaceX reported raising $1.9 billion in private funding. This plus funding series J though M equals around $3.2 billion.([https://craft.co/spacex/funding-rounds](https://craft.co/spacex/funding-rounds)) 

By the end of September Musk tweeted ""We will probably IPO Starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth &amp; predictable” and that “I’m a huge fan of small retail investors. Will make sure they get top priority. You can hold me to it.""

Did something occur between March and September that changed zero to probably? Bill Ackman’s SPAC Pershing Square Tontine Holdings (PSTH) IPOs July 22. A blank check company with $5-7 billion to spend, specific acquisition requirements, and marketed as “the most investor friendly SPAC in the world.” Despite no announced target, there are substantial investments by Guggenheim, Baupost, Soroban, etc. ([https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PSTH&amp;subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PSTH&amp;subView=institutional))

In October, Momentus announced it will go public through a reverse merger with Stable Road. Their partnership with SpaceX and backing by Prime Movers Lab establishes a tenuous connection between Musk and Ackman as well as aligning interests.

In December, after reports that SpaceX was seeking funding to double its valuation to $92 billion, Musk coyly responds “Incorrect.” The following day u/Mobiledead posts a screenshot of Bill Ackman following SpaceX on Twitter. 

When I read the PSTH=SpaceX speculation I wrote it off as being as likely as Subway or Pornhub. But when I looked into the timeline of the various threads, there were some stars that seemed to align for Starlink. Bill Ackman was offering the right amount to help complete Starlink’s constellation. The $5-7 billion could fit the 10-20% minority share he intended to acquire with the SPAC depending on how much of SpaceX's valuation is derived from Starlink. Ackman would take the largest SPAC to date and bring internet connection to the entire world cementing his legacy as an investor and an activist. Musk would be able to stop funneling money from his true passion with SpaceX, the Mars mission. And most importantly even small retail investors would see astronomical returns. 

The main argument against Starlink, in my opinion, is Musk’s prediction of an IPO several years in the future and his tweet cautioning investors about SPACs. ([https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1329483695493931009](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1329483695493931009)) My counterargument: He says a lot of shit on Twitter. Although Starlink does not fit every acquisition criteria, we know Ackman was in talks with AirBnB at one point and they are missing some of the acquisition criteria as well. I don't think that Starlink is the most likely candidate for PSTH but I no longer think that it is entirely impossible. This is purely speculation and I'm sure there are things I've missed. If there's something I'm misunderstanding feel free to correct me.

**ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS MORE “ARTIFICAL” THAN “INTELLIGENT”**

As has been dutifully noted by many fellow autists, Palantir is an artificial intelligence/algorithim data mangement software company. However, you don’t quite have to worry about your wife going off and getting a robot boyfriend anytime soon. While this may come to a surprise to Jeffery Epstein’s pal Steve Hawking[who believed robots will soon take over the world](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/stephen-hawking-named-epstein-unsealed-files-virginia-giuffre-ghislaine-maxwell-1521920%3famp=1)  smart people in the field have been dealing with solving the problems of making artificial intelligence work for decades. This is good news for all those that have diamond hands 💎👐 on their Palantir shares in the coming years, because one of the founders solved one of the major problems over a decade ago and I’ll tell you how.


**The problem with Artificial Intelligence and the Palantir Solution**


If you aren’t yet familiar with [Stephen Cohen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cohen_(entrepreneur)) you should be. This is the ultimate autist chad that coded the first prototype of Palantir in 8 weeks. At his time at Stanford, he studied machine learning and artifical intelligence (this was way back in 2005, these beasts of nature are always 20~ years ahead of the normie media and their trends). However, as Cohen himself mentions in his talk at Stanford [“The Path to Palantir”](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g_6_kGDdjwI) he became dissapointed studying AI due to the many limitations of the field he quickly realized. Firstly, the AI is only ever as smart as the algorithms that the humans were able to develop, thus more “artificial” than “intelligent.” Secondly, while computers are able to store and calculate numbers even faster than an autist doing his math homework before his mom will let him have his tendies, and their superior skill at storing this information, computers cannot grasp numerous concepts that human’s are skilled at. Most fundamentally, this is creativity and anything that is subjective. The example Cohen uses in his speech is hunger. Try explaining the feeling of hunger to someone and while you may be able to quantify it as a number between 1-10, this quantification leaves a lot out that someone that has never experienced hunger would understand. To put it simply, there are numerous factors in life that are impossible for a computer to qualify. Computers are good at factors they can quantify (numbers) but are as retarded as your average WSB bottom feeder when it comes to the qualitative (subjective). This is where Palantir comes in. Effectively, Palantir solves the quantitative issues for the human and lays it out for humans to interact with and add in qualitative analysis. Palantir is a marriage between a computer’s impeccable ability to process and store numbers and data and humans impeccable ability to use creativity and view context as well as the subjective. 


**Software &amp; Business: The Dinosaur Superstructure**


Heres where our other founder bellwether [Peter Thiel ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) comes in. If you haven’t heard of him yet, your girlfriend probably doesn’t you stay out past 8 PM, even when she’s not home. Member of the paypal mafia, when hes not busy making billions with his buddies musk and bezos, he’s [taking down Gawker with Hulk Hogan ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/06/21/peter-thiels-war-on-gawker-a-timeline/?sh=78387f3251c5)for outing his private sex life. Like how Cohenknows how computer’s work, Thiel knows how businesses work. How many people here have been in an actual office building? Probably not the right crowd, I know, most of you still live in your parent’s basement, but that won’t matter when PLTR moons. Anyway, one of the first things youll notice is that the majority of technology used by businesses and governments are older than the average /r/teenagers poster. [According to research conducted by Kaspersky, “four in ten of very small businesses (VSB), and roughly half of small and medium-sized businesses (SMB), still rely on operating systems such as Windows XP or Windows 7 which are nearing their end of life.”](https://www.itproportal.com/amp/news/businesses-still-dependent-on-outdated-software/) For some reason, I cannot find similar statistics for even larger companies that would be more likely for Palantir to be working with, but i’d wager from experience and knowing the scaleability issues that come with updating to technology, especially when dealing with a bunch of boomers, that it would be even higher for large companies. However, this is great news, because our good friend Thiel has the perfect formula to grab the biggest 6000 businesses by the balls.


Essentially, Palantir fronts the costs of installing and getting the software embedded into an operation in it’s “acquisition contract” stage. Im not a finance frog, but from what I understand they don’t actually make money from these contracts. Hence why they haven’t been profitable. However, the model is like a snowball. After the acquisition contract has expired, the boomers running the operation Palantir is contracting to have finally figured out how to use the software without training wheels and it is entrenched in their companies business. A larger contract with higher margins is signed. Further, companies of that companies competition look at what Palantir has done for that company, such as when in Q3 Palantir found 315m in unnecessary spending for an oil and gas company, slotting to save the company 1b in the coming 12 months https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx and they are forced to sign an acquisition contract, further pushing the snowball along and acting as a case study of success for Palantir. 


Remember to diamond hands and buy that dip. The markets are an unmedicated bipolar teenaged girl on her period and currently Palantir is in a downswing, but that is only a buying opportunity for the wise of us. Short term, I could see Palantir dipping as low as $20. This negative feedback loop will be broken either by a new contract, Karp interview day, another media announcement, or demo day. Eventually. I’ll lose a lot of you here, if I already havent, but hold strong and don’t stress the short term as long as you agree with my thesis and have done/seen enough due diligence of your own to understand the fundamentals of this company are as solid as Karp’s skiing legs. Longer term, I can see this company being at 100b+ market cap being conservative.
