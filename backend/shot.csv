ew3tmt,I'm only going to say this once. Stop shorting TSLA,"First things first if you lost money going against Elon its fucking well deserved.

For all the crying I hear about the fUnDaMeNtAlS not adding up, that is the lie you tell yourself to justify getting your ass destroyed.
Let's not act like fundamentals is the sole factor that drives all stocks.

The truth is you traded TSLA on raw fucking emotion and this is what you get for going against Elon. Your stupid ass said ""wow TSLA is uppy alotty so it must come back downy."" Solid fucking DD your ass got rapey. Congratulations.

How the fuck can you 100% give a value on a company that has no direct comparables and don't give me that GM Ford bullshit.

Say it with me ""Tesla is not just a car company"" 

Fucking say it out loud, I see you just reading. SAY IT!

It's funny how some of you fucks will ride a meme stock to the high havens but look at TSLA and start talking about value. Fucks.

Imagine trying to explain to your future child about how you lost a shit ton of money on TSLA because fundamentals.... Little Jimmy will be looking back at you rockin his Tesla prosthetic legs and call you a fucking idiot.

The point, stop shorting TSLA don't borrow the stock sell it, don't buy puts, don't sell calls, just fucking quit.

Overall if you cant understand TSLAs move, which most people can't just don't trade the fucking stock. Stay away, you don't have to trade what you don't understand.",Stocks

ew1jkt,Volatility Buildup In Chinese Market,"Hey all,

Here's a series post about making some serious cash. 

***What's Happening?***

The Wu-flu epidemic is far from cresting. The Chinese markets are closed and will be closed through Monday. The reason the markets are closed for this extended period of time is to avoid market volatility and prevent the Chinese market from crashing.

What is happening is the opposite, at least where volatility is concerned. It is building up and will pop when and if the markets open this coming Monday.

I am encouraging everyone to get in on this. Even if it's a small pop, it will be a pop. If it's a big one, then we clean up and everyone has a good day except the artistic inverters.

***What's The Play?***

Buy puts on FXI. That's the play. Play it how you like it. I'm already in and waiting to hopefully make some nice tendies come Monday. I would consider buying them a little bit out in the case that the Market gets an even further delayed opening.

Credit to u/Leaky_Buns for the play. He's been saying it all over the sub for the past few days and I think he is correct.

***Where's The Proof?***

*Taiwan and Hong Kong Markets Take a Hit*

The Taiwanese and Hong Kong markets both opened this week to about -6% and -3% respectively after their return from the lunar holidays.

They are both continuing to drop. They are heavily reliant on the Chinese economy and should be a good indicator of what will happen once Chinese markets open. 

*Increased Infection Rate*

There's also the fact that the rate of infection is not slowing. Look at this graph from Johns Hopkins University and you'll see the number of reported infections has been increasing exponentially and will likely continue to do so.

https://imgur.com/gallery/OMMZHON

*Businesses Staying Closed*

&gt; Hubei authorities announced late Wednesday that businesses are **not to resume work till midnight on Feb. 13.**

&gt; This week, Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing, Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang announced that businesses are **not to resume work till midnight on Feb. 9.**

Excerpt taken from the CNBC Live Updates page linked below.

*Viral Infection Not Contained*

&gt; ""But the disease has spread far and wide inside China and, with extensive worldwide travel by its citizens, especially during the celebration of the Lunar New Year""

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/health/china-coronavirus-outbreak.html

*Months Until Vaccination Trials Begin*

&gt; Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the N.I.H., who oversees Dr. Graham‚Äôs team, said he expected the vaccine research to move quickly.

&gt; ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt run into any unforeseen obstacles, we‚Äôll be able to get a Phase 1 trial going within the next three months, which will be record speed,‚Äù he said, referring to early human trials that test for safety.

&gt; With each new outbreak, scientists typically have to start from scratch. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months from the release of the viral genome to get a vaccine ready for human trials. By the time an epidemic caused by the Zika virus occurred in 2015, researchers had brought the timeline down to six months. Now, they hope the joint efforts will cut that time in half.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/health/coronavirus-vaccine.html

The virus is not under control.

***Interactive Virus Map from Johns Hopkins University***

This is a handy tool to use to track the viral data on a cool interactive map. It is sometimes a few hours behind, but you can get a near perfect sense of the aggregated medical data available.

Credit to u/hello-world-foo-bar for posting on the sub a few days ago.

ew1uth,I have a conspiracy theory that the Apple ‚ÄúStocks‚Äù app shows you a graph of the market over a strongly bullish timeframe on down days. Help me rest my hypothesis.,"Whenever the market opens low and heads lower, I notice the Apple Stocks app shows me the much more bullish 1- or 2-year chart instead of the daily scary chart. And I don‚Äôt recall looking at the 1- or 2-year chart the night before. 

So if you‚Äôre still awake (Wednesday night) do the following:

* Add the S&amp;P500 to your Apple Stock watch list (if it‚Äôs not already there).
* From the home screen, swipe left to view the stock list, then tap S&amp;P500 to get the graph view.
* Tap the one day view. Don‚Äôt tap any other views. 
* Now go to bed. 

IMPORTANT: now don‚Äôt check the graph view of S&amp;P500 until the market has been open for at least 30 minutes tomorrow morning. 

Then, if the market is down, tap the S&amp;P500 chart view, AND REPORT BELOW WHAT VIEW YOU SEE.",Discussion

ewgrc3,Letter from PROSHARES - SEC proposing restrictions and qualification on leveraged and inverse funds,"Dear ProShares Shareholder,

I am writing to let you know about an unprecedented proposal from the Securities and Exchange Commission (‚ÄúSEC‚Äù) that would make it more burdensome to buy, or even prevent you from buying, leveraged and inverse funds, such as the ones offered by ProShares. You have the right to offer your view on these proposed regulations, which you can do by submitting comments to the SEC through [www.fundcomments.com](https://www.fundcomments.com).

The Proposed Regulations

Under the proposed regulations, you would be required to provide extensive personal financial and other information and be evaluated to determine if you will be allowed to buy leveraged and inverse funds. This would be the case even if you make your own investment decisions or you have engaged a financial professional to make those decisions for you.

We strongly believe the proposed regulations are:

1. Bad for Investors. If the proposal is adopted, some investors who could benefit from the enhanced return and portfolio protection potential of leveraged and inverse funds could be prevented from buying them by an overly burdensome qualification process. Brokerage firms could even stop offering these funds altogether due to the difficulty of implementing the regulations.

2. Unnecessary. The SEC has not shown there is a problem that needs to be solved with respect to leveraged and inverse funds. They fail to show why these funds should be treated differently than tens of thousands of other public securities, each with their own characteristics and risks.

3. A Dangerous Precedent. Requiring you to qualify to purchase a security in the public markets would be an unjustified break with how the SEC‚Äôs regulation of the sale of securities in the public markets has worked for nearly 90 years. The proposal would be at odds with our long-standing system that gives investors and their advisors the freedom to make their own investment decisions.

What You Can Do

You have the right to voice your view by submitting comments on this proposal. The SEC is required to take your comments into consideration in deciding whether to go forward with the rule as proposed.

If you would like to let your views be known, you can submit comments to the SEC through [www.fundcomments.com](https://www.fundcomments.com). The deadline to make comments is March 24, 2020, so consider acting now.

(continued on reverse)

&amp;#x200B;

We encourage you to submit your views on the proposed regulations, including, if you agree, that:

‚Ä¢ Leveraged and inverse funds are important to you, and they allow you to seek enhanced returns or help you protect your portfolio.

‚Ä¢ You are capable of understanding leveraged and inverse funds and their performance characteristics, and you don‚Äôt want a third party evaluating your capability to do so and potentially preventing you from buying them.

‚Ä¢ You want to preserve the long-standing free public markets where investors and their advisors have the freedom to buy public securities without additional government-imposed limitations on investor choice.

\*\*\*

Having spoken with ProShares shareholders over the last 13 years, I believe it is likely you value leveraged and inverse funds. I hope you will join me in telling the SEC you want to maintain your current access to these funds.

For more information about the proposal, visit [www.sec.gov/rules/proposed.shtml](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed.shtml) and go to Release No. 34-87607, dated November 25, 2019. If you have questions for us regarding this matter or how to submit comments, please contact our investor line at 888-776-3898, or email us at [secproposal@proshares.com](mailto:secproposal@proshares.com).

As always, thank you for having made the decision to be a ProShares shareholder. We look forward to continuing to provide exchange-traded funds that empower you to pursue your financial objectives.

Sincerely,

Michael L. Sapir Chairman",Stocks

Statistics:

¬∑ CV has almost infected the same amount of people as SARS in half the time.

¬∑ SARS killed 9% of infected

¬∑ CV has killed about 2% of infected

¬∑ CV has had a 2x faster response by the government than SARS 

Sentiment drivers

Just finished talking with one of my Chinese friends in Beijing that works in the finance district (we bounce trade ideas all the time) most of this is already known yet here are the key takeaways

1. Chinese gov expects it to get worse, much worse. Hints the building of several new hospitals with large capacities (but we knew that)

2. Despite efforts of Chinese gov people are still traveling for the new year (wont bore you with details why, not so easy to cancel vacation)

3. All schools, colleges, internships closed (expected)

4. Here is the kicker to the economy, this virus is early stage and jobs are already closing. Many work places have mandates telling people not to work unless you are an essential employee, some people still don‚Äôt want to go. This hits the poor areas harder, the manufacturing districts, which will have trade/supply impacts for the U.S. if this gets much worse.   

5. There are also hints (because china doses this) that the gov is not telling the whole story. (other news outlets have suggested this) but im not going to speculate on this, small impact, it‚Äôs just something to keep in mind if the news were to be official then the impact could be huge.

This is not everything but a small summary of what is causing the overreaction. Typically, looking back at Ebola and others, the market tends to over react at first, bounce back a little in a bull trap as people see it as a buying opportunity before falling some more, then finally recovering in a short time (under a month) Ive been out of the market since Friday but I anticipate being back in soon. Bearish for 1-2 weeks then bullish again.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is what i posted Friday on a different platform (couldn't post it here because i had to make a new account) on how to trade if you are interested. Most of these plays have ended but there is still some growth here. Some plays may still be there if it gets worse

&amp;#x200B;

  

Intuitively you think the following stocks would be up but here‚Äôs why they are not:

$MMM ‚Äì masks are a small part of 3M business; its other segments will hurt more than masks will add to their bottom line down during Ebola, this is confirmed as it is set to open down

Also keep in mind most healthcare goes down as the market freaks out and sells off and there‚Äôs trade concerns. So don‚Äôt just buy anything because its healthcare.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What Did well in outbreaks ‚Äì look for business with a product mix that will profit the most ex. A provider of only protective gear not one where it is a small portion of their overall business

$LAKE Ebola it was up 300% premarket 16% Monday and up today 1/30

$APT same play as $LAKE

Different BIO tech stocks will move based on who is actively looking for a cure, gov grants, ect. Generally, biotech does well. Take a look at $ABBV

The country with far lower vaccine use reports such low numbers because they only consider deaths directly and solely caused by the flu, whereas the US counts a death due to a virus even if it just exacerbated a preexisting illness.

The Hang Seng market in Hong Kong and TWSE in Taiwan are continuing to tank. It is just a whiff of what is going to happen in Shanghai come Monday. 

Market volatility is brewing and bubbling. 10 days of closed markets in Shanghai have backed up market volatility so high that it is going to come spewing out and spill over to all the other asiatic markets.

It will be equivalent of that scene in Stand By Me when everyone is throwing up on each other except coming out of Chinese companies assholes.

People saying it's already priced in because things are already trading down on other markets are going to be sorely disappointed and left putting vaseline on their anal fissures from getting fucking so hard.

Markets are going to bleed red on Monday. R.I.P. chinese equities.

Get your puts in on anything Chinese. My choices are on index funds. Here's what to play:

- Puts on FXI (cheapest)
- Puts on YINN 
- Calls on YANG (it's an inverse fund)

Once you make your money, consider feeling out the market for the bottom and buy back in on Chinese equities or calls there on out and ride the market back up. 

Despite being a third world country in many parts of the countryside and causing this kind of fucked up market volatility in the first place, China's middle class is larger than the entire population of the United States. You won't lose in the long run by betting on them to succeed. 

My big three stock choices for the next 10 years are:

- Luckin Coffee
- Alibaba
- NIO

This is because the rolling 2 month correlation between Coronavirus and Corona beer is negative right now, so you‚Äôre essentially buying the virus on margin (this is legitimate science I might add: https://thehill.com/homenews/news/480506-corona-beer-virus-searches-spike-amid-coronavirus-spread).  I‚Äôm not joking, my dudes, this is basic biology and economics knowledge.

ewbhgw,The corona virus could have a positive effect in the long run for us,"Ok just hear me out on this one. Let‚Äôs say 10 million ppl die all over the world cuz of this virus. Sure the first thing tht comes to mind is the fact tht the negative impact it‚Äôs gonna have on China n shit BUT its actually the other way. U might ask why? How could it be the other around? It‚Äôs bc of GDP. GDP is the sum of household spending, gov‚Äôt spending, investments and exports. In a situation like this 10 million families are gonna get insurance money. The gov‚Äôt is gonna spend more to improve everything so shit like this won‚Äôt happen again. Sure exports probably won‚Äôt have a positive effect but the gov‚Äôt and consumer spending is a lot more than that. So a positive net GDP. This means that ppl are gonna have confidence in the economy and other shit which means they are going to start doing the shit they did before the virus.

We were talking about what the cafeteria was going to have for lunch today because I was in my first year of college (I went to business school so you can trust me on this. I did Toastmasters). So I go to Google and type in the school cafeteria website and in that moment I had a thought and asked him:


**""What would Google have to do, or what would actually have to happen for Google to go bankrupt?""**
 
 
 
 
It would have to be something so catastrophic that every business in the world would simultaneously stop functioning. I'm 150% sure that Tesla is in the same exact situation.



Literally what is Tesla? Tesla doesn't even exist. It's ingrained into our minds as a car company but he's memeing the shit out of everybody on social media. It's all a huge fucking meme and people are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to support it. He put a shitty iPad on a car chassis and sold it to people with iPads and laptops and iPhones. You can't even remove it from the car. It doesn't even have 4k (need a citation for this). 


At this point it makes no sense to say Tesla will do anything but go up because it would literally take a world ending scenario for anything else to happen. In fact, there's a Tesla **IN FUCKING SPACE.** So the fact is that it would require the legitimate end of the universe for Tesla to go down. Musk said ""a cybertruck might exist in 2 years"" and people threw him millions of dollars. He's using the Call of Duty pre-order model except without refunds and these retards are still finding ways to believe this isn't watertight You can't put a valuation on this. Nobody can.

ewcf60,First U.S. Wuhan virus death prediction,"* Bat-soup virus supposedly transmitted even before people start showing symptoms.  
* Only patients with Wuhan travel history and symptoms are tested.  
* Incubation period is around one week, after that weakest die around one week since showing symptoms.

So theoretically there a lot of ramen virus carriers in the U.S. who are incubating, transmitting and some of them already starting to show mild symptoms, but they think it is regular flu and they are not tested because they don‚Äôt have any connection to China. Tests are expensive, they are not performed on all patients showing flu-like symptoms.  

Current timeline:  
China has detected new virus mid-December,  then closed bat soup market on Jan 1st when they had 41 confirmed case, then got first death on Jan 10th.  
U.S. got first patient confirmed by test on Jan 21st.  
On Jan 29 we had 5 confirmed patients with symptoms - that is similar to situation in China mid-December.  

Prediction:  
If we apply direct approximation, around Feb 14th U.S. should have 40 lab-confirmed patients, then around February 25th U.S. will have first death due to Wuhan virus.  
Mid-March U.S. might have 100 fatalities when government enacts quarantine of L.A. area with Cybertrucks blocking all roads in and out.
