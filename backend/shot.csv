ew1jkt,Volatility Buildup In Chinese Market,"Hey all,

Here's a series post about making some serious cash. 

***What's Happening?***

The Wu-flu epidemic is far from cresting. The Chinese markets are closed and will be closed through Monday. The reason the markets are closed for this extended period of time is to avoid market volatility and prevent the Chinese market from crashing.

What is happening is the opposite, at least where volatility is concerned. It is building up and will pop when and if the markets open this coming Monday.

I am encouraging everyone to get in on this. Even if it's a small pop, it will be a pop. If it's a big one, then we clean up and everyone has a good day except the artistic inverters.

***What's The Play?***

Buy puts on FXI. That's the play. Play it how you like it. I'm already in and waiting to hopefully make some nice tendies come Monday. I would consider buying them a little bit out in the case that the Market gets an even further delayed opening.

Credit to u/Leaky_Buns for the play. He's been saying it all over the sub for the past few days and I think he is correct.

***Where's The Proof?***

*Taiwan and Hong Kong Markets Take a Hit*

The Taiwanese and Hong Kong markets both opened this week to about -6% and -3% respectively after their return from the lunar holidays.

They are both continuing to drop. They are heavily reliant on the Chinese economy and should be a good indicator of what will happen once Chinese markets open. 

*Increased Infection Rate*

There's also the fact that the rate of infection is not slowing. Look at this graph from Johns Hopkins University and you'll see the number of reported infections has been increasing exponentially and will likely continue to do so.

https://imgur.com/gallery/OMMZHON

*Businesses Staying Closed*

&gt; Hubei authorities announced late Wednesday that businesses are **not to resume work till midnight on Feb. 13.**

&gt; This week, Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing, Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang announced that businesses are **not to resume work till midnight on Feb. 9.**

Excerpt taken from the CNBC Live Updates page linked below.

*Viral Infection Not Contained*

&gt; ""But the disease has spread far and wide inside China and, with extensive worldwide travel by its citizens, especially during the celebration of the Lunar New Year""

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/health/china-coronavirus-outbreak.html

*Months Until Vaccination Trials Begin*

&gt; Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the N.I.H., who oversees Dr. Graham’s team, said he expected the vaccine research to move quickly.

&gt; “If we don’t run into any unforeseen obstacles, we’ll be able to get a Phase 1 trial going within the next three months, which will be record speed,” he said, referring to early human trials that test for safety.

&gt; With each new outbreak, scientists typically have to start from scratch. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months from the release of the viral genome to get a vaccine ready for human trials. By the time an epidemic caused by the Zika virus occurred in 2015, researchers had brought the timeline down to six months. Now, they hope the joint efforts will cut that time in half.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/health/coronavirus-vaccine.html

The virus is not under control.

***Interactive Virus Map from Johns Hopkins University***

This is a handy tool to use to track the viral data on a cool interactive map. It is sometimes a few hours behind, but you can get a near perfect sense of the aggregated medical data available.

Credit to u/hello-world-foo-bar for posting on the sub a few days ago.

ew1uth,I have a conspiracy theory that the Apple “Stocks” app shows you a graph of the market over a strongly bullish timeframe on down days. Help me rest my hypothesis.,"Whenever the market opens low and heads lower, I notice the Apple Stocks app shows me the much more bullish 1- or 2-year chart instead of the daily scary chart. And I don’t recall looking at the 1- or 2-year chart the night before. 

So if you’re still awake (Wednesday night) do the following:

* Add the S&amp;P500 to your Apple Stock watch list (if it’s not already there).
* From the home screen, swipe left to view the stock list, then tap S&amp;P500 to get the graph view.
* Tap the one day view. Don’t tap any other views. 
* Now go to bed. 

IMPORTANT: now don’t check the graph view of S&amp;P500 until the market has been open for at least 30 minutes tomorrow morning. 

Then, if the market is down, tap the S&amp;P500 chart view, AND REPORT BELOW WHAT VIEW YOU SEE.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ew1uth/i_have_a_conspiracy_theory_that_the_apple_stocks/,Power80770M,1,2020-01-30 00:43:09,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ew1uth/i_have_a_conspiracy_theory_that_the_apple_stocks/,Discussion,0

ew3tmt,I'm only going to say this once. Stop shorting TSLA,"First things first if you lost money going against Elon its fucking well deserved.

For all the crying I hear about the fUnDaMeNtAlS not adding up, that is the lie you tell yourself to justify getting your ass destroyed.
Let's not act like fundamentals is the sole factor that drives all stocks.

The truth is you traded TSLA on raw fucking emotion and this is what you get for going against Elon. Your stupid ass said ""wow TSLA is uppy alotty so it must come back downy."" Solid fucking DD your ass got rapey. Congratulations.

How the fuck can you 100% give a value on a company that has no direct comparables and don't give me that GM Ford bullshit.

Say it with me ""Tesla is not just a car company"" 

Fucking say it out loud, I see you just reading. SAY IT!

It's funny how some of you fucks will ride a meme stock to the high havens but look at TSLA and start talking about value. Fucks.

Imagine trying to explain to your future child about how you lost a shit ton of money on TSLA because fundamentals.... Little Jimmy will be looking back at you rockin his Tesla prosthetic legs and call you a fucking idiot.

The point, stop shorting TSLA don't borrow the stock sell it, don't buy puts, don't sell calls, just fucking quit.

Overall if you cant understand TSLAs move, which most people can't just don't trade the fucking stock. Stay away, you don't have to trade what you don't understand.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ew3tmt/im_only_going_to_say_this_once_stop_shorting_tsla/,MesterDB,1,2020-01-30 04:12:56,1062,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ew3tmt/im_only_going_to_say_this_once_stop_shorting_tsla/,Stocks,0

ewgrc3,Letter from PROSHARES - SEC proposing restrictions and qualification on leveraged and inverse funds,"Dear ProShares Shareholder,

I am writing to let you know about an unprecedented proposal from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that would make it more burdensome to buy, or even prevent you from buying, leveraged and inverse funds, such as the ones offered by ProShares. You have the right to offer your view on these proposed regulations, which you can do by submitting comments to the SEC through [www.fundcomments.com](https://www.fundcomments.com).

The Proposed Regulations

Under the proposed regulations, you would be required to provide extensive personal financial and other information and be evaluated to determine if you will be allowed to buy leveraged and inverse funds. This would be the case even if you make your own investment decisions or you have engaged a financial professional to make those decisions for you.

We strongly believe the proposed regulations are:

1. Bad for Investors. If the proposal is adopted, some investors who could benefit from the enhanced return and portfolio protection potential of leveraged and inverse funds could be prevented from buying them by an overly burdensome qualification process. Brokerage firms could even stop offering these funds altogether due to the difficulty of implementing the regulations.

2. Unnecessary. The SEC has not shown there is a problem that needs to be solved with respect to leveraged and inverse funds. They fail to show why these funds should be treated differently than tens of thousands of other public securities, each with their own characteristics and risks.

3. A Dangerous Precedent. Requiring you to qualify to purchase a security in the public markets would be an unjustified break with how the SEC’s regulation of the sale of securities in the public markets has worked for nearly 90 years. The proposal would be at odds with our long-standing system that gives investors and their advisors the freedom to make their own investment decisions.

What You Can Do

You have the right to voice your view by submitting comments on this proposal. The SEC is required to take your comments into consideration in deciding whether to go forward with the rule as proposed.

If you would like to let your views be known, you can submit comments to the SEC through [www.fundcomments.com](https://www.fundcomments.com). The deadline to make comments is March 24, 2020, so consider acting now.

(continued on reverse)

&amp;#x200B;

We encourage you to submit your views on the proposed regulations, including, if you agree, that:

• Leveraged and inverse funds are important to you, and they allow you to seek enhanced returns or help you protect your portfolio.

• You are capable of understanding leveraged and inverse funds and their performance characteristics, and you don’t want a third party evaluating your capability to do so and potentially preventing you from buying them.

• You want to preserve the long-standing free public markets where investors and their advisors have the freedom to buy public securities without additional government-imposed limitations on investor choice.

\*\*\*

Having spoken with ProShares shareholders over the last 13 years, I believe it is likely you value leveraged and inverse funds. I hope you will join me in telling the SEC you want to maintain your current access to these funds.
