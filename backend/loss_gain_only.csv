What's the concensus boys?

How long is this Bear Market? 3 more days, or 3 more months.

I did invest a bigger chunk in some things that I think will make money in the long run. Short or long term, when does it make sense to sell something at a profit and reinvest that money into buying more quantities of something cheaper or something more long term? 

Example, I buy 60 lesser stock (not Apple, Tesla, etc) at $10, it goes up up to $50 but based on 5 years in the past it won't go much higher. I could sell that stock for $3000 and buy either lots of some some other smaller stock and hope to repeat or buy less of something bigger like Tesla.

Then about a month ago I decided to do some risky plays (the oldest story in the books).

I got caught in the oil dip along with some other things and quickly lost 60k -_-

I got to enjoy life changing money and within a very short period got to see it fall through my fingers..

85,j986f4,1 Year Gains - 90% Stocks 10% Options,"For those doubting stocks as decent investment (bets) vs options, here's my 1 year gains from 90% stock 10% options. 

I mostly buy stocks, specifically looking at IPOs, M&amp;A targets, and high growth companies. 90% of my portfolio is in stocks with the other 10% in option plays. (https://imgur.com/FcSPC94)

I'll place small bets on risky options plays, but never yolo big into any one bet. Right now have options plays in NKLA, GM, BLL, XOM, FIT, PSTH, and OZK. All calls except for OZK. The gains potential is much higher for calls vs puts, so if I'm going to make a high risk bet, I at least want the gains to be worthwhile.

When an options play turns out well, I rebalance into some more stocks to generally maintain the 9 to 1 ratio.

For stocks, I use stop market orders to prevent huge losses when the market tanks or bad news spreads. Depending on the stock volatility, I'll set the stop market trigger just below my cost basis or 90% of the stock price. That dip in March was me basically liquidating my whole portfolio, and sitting out for a couple weeks.

It's not crazy gains like some people on here, but I've gone from ~10k to ~50k in a year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j986f4/1_year_gains_90_stocks_10_options/,peakfreak18,1,2020-10-11 10:13:16,134,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j986f4/1_year_gains_90_stocks_10_options/,Gain,0

While I love Schwab they don't have chart breakdowns for individual accounts so I have to show the chart for the entire Schwab portfolio.

Only about one quarter of my portfolio is options the rest is in boomer stocks.

My main option plays are mainly bought 3-6 months out and I usually sell six weeks before expiration unless it hits my limit sell. Every major play I already have an exit date and number in mind. My biggest wins have been with **NIO** and **F**. I shouldn't have to tell you this but **I only got option level 1 approval in February whereupon I lost my ass on SPCE.** Didn't start going hard on it until a couple months ago.

I do buy **FD's** with spare cash in the account but basically go into it knowing I'm losing just like I have every time playing roulette. I also have **LEAPs** in a few companies like **CVS, LUV, VIAC, Luckin, F, GE, Uber.**

The rest of my portfolio is pure boomer. All high yield dividend shit along with cruise lines and boomer companies that recently cut their dividends. These accounts I've been building since around 2014. I've made the most so far on **CAT** and **TXN**. Lost the most on big oil. **Fuck you XOM**.

Ended up losing half of the 4k I started with in April. Was up a decent amount in June but got raped by sideways movement and this recent 'dip'. Embarrassing as it is half of my losses were in actual shares not options lol. Just not made for this. Consistently found the shittiest companies to buy calls/shares in (PCG, RKT to name a few). Also sold the bottom many times only for shit to moon the next day.

As a service to you all I just liquidated the final stock I had (RKT) for a 200 dollar loss so calls on that probably a safe bet. Need to get out of the market and just focus on my mental health right now.

I did want to thank you all for the laughs. Despite the losses finding this community was the one good thing that came out of this whole experience. You guys are fucking hilarious and never fail to put a grin on my face.

375,iyhrgw,$1.15 million in 7 months!,"Hi everybody, I hope you are all doing very well! 

I‚Äôm here to write a quick story of my forex trading journey in the past 7 months. When I first heard about foreign-exchange, i started watching videos on YouTube about how successful are some lucky people, and they are the so called 1% who live a life of what many people just dream about. 

So, I decided to do further research about this and how does it really work. A started to learn about candle stick patterns, and money management. Then I got to know that maybe I could be successful in this too, as a seemed to understand fairly quickly how the market actually works. 

I opened a demo account, which had a balance of $5000. I had many ups and down with my demo account, but as i got more into it, i managed to make $25,628,81 in 5-6 weeks. 

This is why I decided to open a live account and start trading with that. I deposited $17,500, and started doing the same strategy that has been working in my demo account. 

After many sleepless night I started to make consistent gains, this showed me that trading is actually a good business. 

At a total I made $1,150,000.00 to proof this I‚Äôm posting another picture, you can find that on my page or Wall Street bets.

I hope my post motivates everybody, and I also decided to help other trader who are struggling, because if I knew the things I know now I could have made the same amount of money in 1-3 months. 
So if anybody‚Äôs interested for my words and helping you I‚Äôm happy to do so. Just send me a private message! 

And I also started my signals group, where I exactly tell you when to place trades, as well I give you my set ups! 

So please check out my photo of my gains! 

I wish you all the best!",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iyhrgw/115_million_in_7_months/,monstatrades,1,2020-09-23 13:58:40,23,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iyhrgw/115_million_in_7_months/,Gain,0

456,ip2w12,"Help me... Down 95% All Time, 70% Just Today","I'm so fucking disappointed in myself. I was recovering, finally recovering some of my lost money. I lost a shit ton on SPY puts in March. I was retardedly bearish during the entire recovery and flipped a few weeks ago. Finally started seeing some green and was getting back to where I was in before March. And then the market tanked again and I was expecting at least modest green today recovering from the dramatic drop. Of course I was wrong and lost $7k. I'm just always late on the trend and overconfident. I can't imagine how I recover from this aside from years of saving and just never touching options again. You know, maybe that's just the way to go. There is no guaranteed get-rich-quick scheme. Please help me, and thanks in advance for anything you guys have to offer. Also fuck you and fuck me for trying to buy the dip without any sign of momentum change. And fuck SPY for continuing to drop after hours. I've been bag holding SPY $347c 9/11 NFLX $530c 9/11 and NVDA $495c 9/11. Should I just sell tomorrow and walk out with the $2k I'll have left?  

At least it was money I could afford to lose and I'm still young, but damn... I really messed up.

528,iyl0oj,Game Over ($OUCH),"So as it turns out, stonks do not always go up.

To give a brief tale of woe, I launched into OTM PCG Gang Calls, OTM SLV Gang Calls, OTM AAPL Calls, and then OTM VALE FD's back to back over the course of about two months. Long strings of words with compelling reasoning certainly brought my cock up into a raging stiffie, and I proceeded to YOLO into several different losses. What can I say? A fool and his money are soon parted. Fortunately, it's just money. 

Part of me wants to say ""I'm never coming back and following some retard into the abyss again"", but let's be honest. I'll be back after a couple of paychecks. If there's any lesson to take here, it's that the better a DD seems, the worse it actually is. The only play I actually made any goddamn money on was fucking Rent A Center. 

And yes, I know, 14K is chump change. Just figured y'all might appreciate some good ol' loss porn in these trying times.

575,iymjws,"Buy NKLA , save a life.($25,462)","Hello!

Today I thought it would be a good idea to sell naked NKLA puts striking at 26.5, 24, 21.5, 20, 18.5, 17.5$ expiring this Friday. 

Unfortunately those puts are very very leveraged. I am currently at a paper loss of  25,462$ on the day. ( [proof](http://imgur.com/gallery/WPXLGMi) )

I also had to sell all my profitible positions to get room for the margin calls.  In spite of this I ended up getting liqidated on a bunch of OTM puts that spiked in value..

I'm now quite literally shitting myself as if NKLA ends up opening significantly down tomorrow morning I'll likely end up owing my broker more money than the total balance in my account. 

If NKLA holds 21.5 through to the end of the week I'll at least be broke even on the month. If it drops and I get liqidated more then I could end up losing MUCH more than just 25,464$ and I won't be able to make it back.

Please consider closing your shorts and selling your puts tomorrow or even buying a few NKLA shares so my life can continue as normal without the ensuing divorce, homelessness etc..etc.. that will happen if it falls sub 21.5$~

Thank you for your time and consideration!

I could‚Äôve made a big brain play and sold when I was up 4000 on an overbought stock that‚Äôd made an $1100 run up off STOCK SPLIT NEWS, while it was on the brink of tanking &amp; rebought the dip to double my share count.

I didn‚Äôt tho, and I‚Äôm a dumbass.Hindsight is 2020 tho and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm on this sub ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èI‚Äôm another one of the stubborn Tesla bulls that‚Äôs bout to be bagholding. 

Real quick though, a moment of silence for all the Tesla call holders the past week and a half üôè

I haven‚Äôt sold yet and I feel like there‚Äôs no point in selling now. They‚Äôre shares so I still feel like they‚Äôre free money in due time. I‚Äôm writing them off and doing some Uber eats the next few weeks to make $500 so I can throw it into the market. 

Although we‚Äôve BEEN overdue for a market correction I can‚Äôt tell if there‚Äôs about to be some more fed intervention or if the markets‚Äôll end up flopping a bit more regardless of it. 

I might take the 500 and stay cash, do put debit spreads on tech to hedge, play spy, idk tbh.

What I do know though is that at the end of the day it‚Äôs just money, and although it feels like it‚Äôs damn near synonymous with oxygen sometimes -it‚Äôs just money and you can ALWAYS make more of it.

That heart attack and wave of depression you get from blowing up your account won‚Äôt last forever if you don‚Äôt let it. 

With that being said Tesla has literally TOO much potential. It‚Äôll be at LEAST 600 EOY. Set up the reminders in the comments. I won‚Äôt buy Tesla calls pre battery day but if that shit lives up to the hype I‚Äôm definitely buying some post. (Might not go all in but fuck it we‚Äôll see) 

The full self driving announcement will be another time I‚Äôll play calls on Tesla AND if this shit ever does get included into sp500 I‚Äôm going all in on the motherfucker and retiring.

600,ja2s5m,Almost 400k profit on OTM AMZN Calls... Pray for me (and some DD),"Amazon has been one of the biggest gainers of the market this year. I have been ordering stuff on amazon for my wife's boyfriend since March. Investors are regarding it as a pandemic stock, making our boy Jeff extremely wealthy.  

Amazon‚Äôs shares have increased by over 100% so far this year as the pandemic boosted e-commerce sales.  Last week I was reminded that tomorrow Tuesday is prime day which lead me to do some research.  Since prime day started in 2015 the company has 5x its value.  

These online ""holiday's"" have become a big deal. Target announced its own ‚ÄòDeal Days‚Äô during the same two-day period, while Walmart said it would feature Black Friday-like savings during its ‚ÄúBig Save Event,‚Äù which starts the evening of Oct. 11 and runs through Oct. 15.  

So i figured i would yolo on some amazon Calls.  They are still OTM and theta is gonna reck me overnight if this doesn't open over 3500.  Wish me luck!

633,iynxne,"Any advice on what to do? I lost $317 in TSLA stock for buying in the ""Battery day"" event","Hey guys.... today and yesterday were awful days for me, I'm depressed as fuck because I basically bought into the hype and bought 4 shares of TSLA stock ($2k) when it was rising in price.

I was feeling great and happy, because the price raised to the point it even made me $20 in profit. And I even took the time to tell my mother about my success, but all of that died down as I saw the stock fall terribly until it reached in the aftermarket hours to $395, I was hitting myself up for the loss.  
And then today in the morning, I saw the stock price go up to $410 (I initially bought these shares at $437), so it wasn't that big of a loss, and I thought there was a light in the tunnel, so I decided to wait.... aaaand at the moment I'm writing this, the stock price is $367. And with that, my market value is now $1667.22, when I started with $2k.

Now the thing is, my subconscious was telling me to sell, 2 times between yesterday and today. But I never did paid attention to that, and I lost more than I wanted.

The bad thing about this? This is basically 66% of my entire savings from 6 months of money I was lucky to make during the pandemic.

I'm so stupid for not doing things right.... and I don't know if I should hold the shares until the price goes back up slowly? Or just sell everything and recoup my entire investment, minus the current loss.

Any advice on what should I do guys?

1. intel blows earnings

3. amd kills earnings 10/27
4. amd peaks mid GPU presentation 10/28
5. sell at peak for sweet $300k or go broke trying

Well since I have faith in my retardation, I bet that step 1 goes as planned and bought 100X AMD 79C 10/23 for $1.31 each. AMD sadly didn't up go up as much as I hoped, but was able to sell them for a cool $2.55 each.

Anyway my friends, it is time to ride this earnings call and earn my tendies or go broke trying. I have about $90K in AMD options that I'll hold through earnings.

Also side note, $TSM makes all the chips for $AMD, and a lot of the chips for $NVDA + $AAPL so side bet on them as well.

I kept buying enough to lower GAK to ‚Ç¨15, and sold everything when it went back up to a tota loss of ‚Ç¨1K (thanks to lowering GAK I came out ok) 

Now the stock price decreased again to 13 and I started buying again, and I bought 70K of Shell again in steps I think it is undervalued.

So i used all my savings and bought turbowarrants with more than x200 leverage like the degen i am. And lo and behold the DJIA went down 1%. Sometimes lucky i guess? Because i have no idea what i am doing.

  
This is easy boys thanks for all the advice, guess i will do this again until i can post a 10k to 1mill back to 10k post.

Sold some shares on the way up, so have realized gains of around \~$12K. 

I pitched Virtu a few weeks ago when tech stocks were rising relentlessly as a hedging stock--didn't get much love as I understand a few people here were burned by the stock. But the stock still has room to grow and has a very low expected downside because the shares are already very cheap. That being said, I would be wary of making a sizeable bet on Virtu right now due to the jump in prices following a mini-explosion of the VIX. The stock is pretty volatile, so I would recommend making a 3-5% sized long-term call position in your portfolio (or stocks if you're risk averse) when the stock price dips 3-5%. If you're a volatility bull like me, increase the position accordingly.

I'm likely going to hold a good amount of Virtu until at least Q3 earnings, although given the volatility of the stock price, I have been day-trading small portions of my position.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ipi9kr/virtu_financial_gains_update_2/,inthedeep,1,2020-09-09 09:38:49,13,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ipi9kr/virtu_financial_gains_update_2/,Gain,0

I won't make that mistake again and I also am hesitant to post DD because somehow you autists take it to the next level, extra chromosome type levels. When I say spreads you do naked calls 50% out of the money. Now that that's out of the way, I'm a big boy and my DD was wrong, but the stock has recovered. If you managed to hold for 6 weeks after earnings then you are probably up. If you got some long dated conservative spreads, you are probably up, if you bought 50% OTM naked calls, you are probably still living in your moms basement. I continue to trade purple because the long term growth story hasn't changed.

As for my gains I have since recovered since earnings day and am now at about 4.1M. I still have oodles of room to run on my January calls and my warrants. Also, I sold 200 contracts for 30P, November expiration. If all goes as planned, I could touch 4.7M towards the beginning of next year. I took the dip as an opportunity to take more positions in 17.5/25.00 calls. I wish I would've done 17.50/30's but hindsight is 20/20, I should hit max profit on this by the end of this week and will roll that profit into more spreads.

900,jarmq0,Down 50k in a day with scalping AMZN. Is stop-loss even viable?,"I am trying to scalp weeklies with stop loss 30% and profit 30%. Since it's weekly, I mostly trade within the same day to avoid being fucked by theta. The thing is, most of the time I hit my -30% lose before even hitting the greens (AKA buying calls at the top). 

On Monday I lost **50k** (-80%) just from these trades after hitting -30%, aside from the gay puts, my calls would have been green if I had held just couple more hours. What are the odds of getting clapped by 4 different trades? Win rate is 0%. 

I need a better plan, but it seems options prices are just so volatile that -30% will be hit within the same day.  What did I do wrong? 

Do you guys just diamond hand it through? trading smaller size with longer DTE?

Hindsight being 20/20, it's easy to see what I SHOULD have done. I knew, or at least expected TSLA to fall, but what I did not expect was the absolutely crushing blow that was dealt. 

The beginning of the decline started off as me selling bull put spreads at the 420 strike when the price of the underlying was over 520. Just like I had done all the way up the mountain. I gave myself a decent cushion, or so I thought. I even managed to roll my positions down to 380 for a credit by pushing them out to October. Perhaps there will be another run up and it will be over that strike by then. Perhaps not. I also should have cut my losses after dropping 40k in the first day of this sell-off. But no, I had to hang in there to see if it would go back up. Nope, just more down. 

Thankfully I have not touched my initial capital and was able to get out before that happened, but I've essentially reset myself back to square 1. I am still up for the year, about 30k. Just enough to cover the 21k in options fees I have racked up so far, and a small withdrawal to pay off a credit card that I took out about 2 months ago. Of course, I still get to pay taxes on that.

As for the being thankful... 

I've learned some valuable, and very expensive lessons. Always protect your capital and don't let yourself get wiped out. Cut losses early and look for another play. It's extremely hard to win your money back in this casino when you're out of chips. Sometimes it is extremely easy to make money in the market, and it sure makes it difficult to want to work a regular job when you're bringing in 10-20k per day. It is also just as easy to lose your ass. Thankfully, this loss will not change my life in the slightest. I only invest/yolo money that I can afford to lose, though that never means that I WANT to.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iplfl3/why_im_thankful_that_i_lost_153598/,ALITTLEBITLOUDER,1,2020-09-09 12:13:39,235,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iplfl3/why_im_thankful_that_i_lost_153598/,Loss,0

931,izj38a,TSLA short straddle $6.6k gains this week. $42k over 4 months.,"I sold a mixture of TSLA puts, strangles, and straddles over the past four months to take advantage of the high IV.  Last week, I sold 9/25 430 , 450, and 470 short straddles as the premium was just too hard to resist.  The market was basically pricing in a 20% move before battery day.  Holding and selling the day before battery day made the most sense to me and it paid off.

I have pretty much always gone down over 50% at some point but my buys have always came back to profit well before the expiry date that I bought the calls at.

It has not been unusual for me to see my account in the negative 100k range on a daily basis but absolutely every time I've seen that I have come back and moved to the positive.

Edit: I keep getting liar callouts - this is one screenshot - if any of you ever make some money you will understand how hard it is to show profit since you'll move your money to different accounts

Being a college student, that‚Äôs a lot of money and my chances of getting back up there any time soon is out the window. Any advice or support would be great :).

FYI, the losses were mostly from Tesla and Apple right before the losses. I‚Äôve literally never touched Tesla or Apple before and they day I do well :) gg.

I would just like to say congrats to all the people that followed me or if were already in congrats as well. All these people on here doubtin the greatest known stock of this century. I‚Äôm gonna be honest with you, after I posted my last message I had some doubt yesterday w the theta eating my contracts away to the brim. I bought in with 15k of contracts beginning of last Friday. Then on Monday decided I could sell a bit and make money elsewhere while NIO was consolidating still which didn‚Äôt work and returned to NIO w the rest of my portfolio. 100% all in. Yesterday my calls dropped 50% in one day and was at only 4500 at one point in my account. All I can say is THANK YOU JP MORGAN. I will be posting more about NIO and upcoming plays and catalysts. I have learned a lot through this rollar coaster. Posting a pic right after this for confirmation.

1144,iq57ue,Last post before i take my life,"I lost my entire life savings on 4th of September. All I have left is one share of Wirecard that i bought as a joke.

[Account 9\/2\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/x5x88fi52cm51.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=113f6d5104c1b463b38feaba729682918e40817e)

I bought the NASDAQ on September 4th a few hours before the market would open for the USA hoping a quick recovery from the past day would kick in. 

I was so convinced it would recover that i leveraged my investment 25x using ""knock-out-certificates"". Nasdaq rises 1% ---&gt; I gain 25% or Nasdaq dips 1% ---&gt; I lose 25%. If it dips 4%, i lose 100% (knock-out).

&amp;#x200B;

[25x leverage NASDAQ \\""knock-out-certificates\\""](https://preview.redd.it/7248c8ib4cm51.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=237c921645a5139678805c51993d7bdc24478671)

Right after open the NASDAQ dipped 4.2%, just below my 11,264 points ""knock-out-price"" losing me my whole investment.

You can see how I tried to panic sell even though the certificates had already been knocked out at that point in time, thus the sell-orders getting rejected.

&amp;#x200B;

The following week I realized how empty my life is.

I have no friends at all, no social life at all, no real plans for the future.

Making some money trading stocks was the only joy I had, which probably led me to increase my risk tolerance more and more until losing it all.

I have barely been eating ever since, I go to bed very early every day because I dont want to be awake anymore and I'm crying myself to sleep every night imagining how disappointed my parents would be if I told them what I had done with the money I saved up in my 18 years.

&amp;#x200B;

This is your dear friend u/trustmeiglow. I come in peace, letting you all know that good news is to come. Don't let a day of turmoil get you down. This is one of three accounts. This is the only one I'll sacrifice to the community. 

TSLA is like sex, you get in and get out. In my village, we call those strokes.  **Sex 101** (You Are Welcome), I just have to learn how to get out, getting in is easy.
