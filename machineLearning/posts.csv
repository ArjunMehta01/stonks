eiftuc,Dumbest trades of 2019,"We see a lot of loss porn, but I wanted to ask about your dumbest trades of 2019. I just made mine so here goes: 

I bought an SPX 12/31 call when it was on sale late in the day. I wasn’t sure if we’d have a small sell off before a closing rally so I was planning to let the call rise up a bit, lock my gain, then buy a January call around power hour anticipating a closing rally. I just got flagged PDT in the morning and it hadn’t cleared so I figured no big deal the 12/31 call is a few strikes ITM so I’ll just sell the next deeper ITM call and use the proceeds to buy the January call an hour before close. 

I waited and watched the chart as SPX slowly rose, pulled back, and rose some more. I figured it was time so I sold the next NTM call (yep!) and locked in a nice little loss. A loss that I had just waited patiently to build up. 

And after that I didn’t even go back and get the January call. Maybe I’d have clicked sell instead of buy or something. 

What was your most impressive feat of stupidity this year?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eiftuc/dumbest_trades_of_2019/,johntaylor37,1,2020-01-01 00:51:23,27,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eiftuc/dumbest_trades_of_2019/,NaN,0

eig4bp,The sad irony of tendies,"WSB tendies are literally the pursuit of pump and dumb or dump and pump bounces. In fact, doing as exactly intended in the most Rambo of ways. 

Fruit flies chasing rooting fruit in bottle trap without planning their way out.

eig6iz,2019 in review.,"2019 was a wild ride for this degenerate sub. I learned some lessons which took me close to a year to finally fucking learn. Broke up with GF so I'll have more money this year. 

We confirmed the afterlife and the paranormal. We saw a man's soul leave his body on camera. The only evidence for this phenomenon is a 'guh' sound. 

Theta gang collects more converts. 

Robinhood is still hot garbage and doesn't know what a spread is. Why we still use this I have no fucking clue. Why people with over 20k use it I don't even know.

Schwab is playing 5-dimensional chess and cut fees to zero. The other big players followed, and Schwab merged with TD.

The deal to sign the deal that signs the deal prior to signing the phase one deal was signed. Still waiting on phase one deal to be signed. 

Stonks only go up.

eij248,How to trade like a professional stonks autist in 2020.,"We all love dropping all our $BECKY bucks on a good TSLA 420.69 call but sometimes stonks go all bearish. So how can you avoid throwing away your kiddies college fund to fulfil your gambling your habit? Well I'm going to try and teach y'all, autist to autist, how to make tendies like u/haput91 makes me-me's and avoid being the next u/analfarmer2. The stonks market awaits!

Note:&gt;! If you think I'm wrong, fuck you. We're all autists and someone has to explain to these degenerates what a stonk is. Go watch Rick and Morty if your IQ isn't too low.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

Idea 1: What the hell is this guy talking about?

Calls/Buys:&gt;! A bet that the stonk will go up to a certain point !&lt;

Puts/Sells&gt;!: A bet that the stonk will go down. !&lt;

Bulls: &gt;!Einsteins who believe stonks only go up! !&lt;

Bears: &gt;!Newtons who believe stonks will always go down! !&lt;

Thetas: &gt;!Beethovens that believe stonks will stay at the same level! !&lt;

Stonks: &gt;!Parts of publicly traded companies that change in value that even a BECKY could buy. !&lt;

BECKY's: &gt;!Like Karens but for stonks. !&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

Point 27: Gimmi those tendies!

So how are we gonna avoid spending little Jimmies college fund? 

First of all we're gonna stop using options. Instead of Calls&amp;Puts use Buys&amp;Sells. You still feel great when you win tendies but instead of loosing 100% on an expiring call you loose 3%, meaning you can make the same mistakes again and again without taking out a third mortgage!

Next? 

That's literally it. All you bulls going GUH as TSLA doesn't stay at $420 would be saving so much $$$ if you just used Buys instead of Calls. Now go inverse whatever I say I'm doing and find out what leverage is for yourself.

Is there any resource to determine when, exactly, the announcement will be? There are really attractive options that expire on the 17th that would make a killing but not if the announcement came after that point.

eim1g2,Real reason Intel why failed to deliver 10nm for so long is because of feminism,"https://www.facebook.com/pg/intelelp/posts/

promoting women and ethnics rather than based purely on merit. 

look at that banner photo, almost 50% are women. no engineering class has 50% women. its obvious most of these women wouldn't end up as new engineers in intel if the criteria was truly merit based

then you see 3 black people in total. what a  joke. 

and there are 5 Asians. ONLY 1 MAN, rest 4 are all women. are you telling me Asian women are better at semiconductor engineering than Asian men? once again, huge gynocentric bias. its almost certain that Asian guy is highly competent because he's subject to the same strict criteria as a ""normal"" white male applicant, while the 4 Asian women are most likely not and chosen because of their gender and being a minority (despite the fact that being an Asian man brings no advantage at all despite being a minority)


&gt;Intel named to the NAFE Top 50 Companies for Executive Women.
The National Association for Female Executives (NAFE) list celebrates U.S. companies that have programs and policies in place that promote the advancement of women, including training, accountability and succession planning. This year marks the 6th time Intel has been recognized on NAFE’s list of top companies for executive women. 

JFL at the blatant gender discrimination

For those who don't know, Intel has fucked up their CPU roadmap. It's been stuck at 14nm for 5 years and the 10nm process has been delayed again and again. And investors and gamers are not happy about it. 

Their former CEO,  Brian Krzanich, was fired for failing to deliver 10nm. To avoid admitting Intel has screwed up their technology, the official reason for his firing was for him having relationship with a female coworker LOL talking about a fucking hypocrite (he wouldn't be fired for that reason or excuse, if he actually delivered the 10nm). and now a bean counter is the new CEO and been in charge. Under that cuck Brian Krzanich, Intel was focused on identify politics, promoting women and blacks, as well as other PC stuffs such as declaring their CPUs ""conflict minerals free"". 

All the nerds on reddit know Intel's 10nm fuckup, how it stagnated CPU tech by keep releasing 4 core mainstream products for 10 years rather than giving out more cores,  and how it allowed its rival AMD to catch up. None of them know the real reason, they just think its greed. The real reasons are far worse.

einfso,Phase 1 trade deal charity bet,"Tards:

A few days ago, in response to news that the Phase1 trade deal is scheduled to be signed on January 15, I expressed my skepticism by saying, ''$20 says it gets delayed.''

Earlier today, u/Cre8or_1 and I agreed to a $20 bet on this. The loser will donate $20 to a charity of the winner's choice. We figured charities need the money more than we do.

Our only caveat is that we're not posting screenshots of the donation (solely because I don't know how to strip identifying information from photos.) So in our case, we'll take each other's word, but we're both committed to paying up if we lose. 

Our specific bet is that the Phase 1 deal will be signed on or before 15 Jan 2019. u/Cre8or_1 says it will. I say it won't. 

That got us thinking. Why not post this in the main thread and see if anyone else wants to set up a side bet for charity?

If interested, post below which side of the trade deal signing you want, the amount of money you're willing to bet, and any specific conditions (for example, ''on or before...'') The only ask is that all proceeds go to the charities of the winners' choices. Each bet is independent and you're on your own for setting the terms with your own counterparty. 

U/Cre8or_1 and I are on for $20. Feel free to set up your own bets below and let's see how many tendies we can donate to good causes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/einfso/phase_1_trade_deal_charity_bet/,1sildurr,1,2020-01-01 13:40:27,23,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/einfso/phase_1_trade_deal_charity_bet/,NaN,0
einh9z,Priced in? China’s central bank inject $115 billion into the financial system despite signs the economy has been improving.,"...  

The cut announced Wednesday was expected by many economists. They see Beijing as trying to find middle ground between supporting economic growth without resorting to more dramatic steps that could rev the economy further but saddle the country with even more debt.

As a result, China’s headline growth figures are widely expected to slow further, though at a measured pace. In the first three quarters of 2019, its output grew 6.2 percent compared with a year before. Still, economists take those figures with a deep amount of skepticism because they tend to be smoother and steadier than those issued by other countries, and they usually hit official targets.

The cut is not unusual so early in the year ahead of China’s Lunar New Year holiday, which begins this year on Jan. 25, and when demand for cash intensifies.

My oldest brother made the brilliant decision that because he lost his job, he should start day trading. He quickly made $30k on Apple by yoloing his saving in shares before an Apple products release event. Excited by this, he made an entire PowerPoint presentation convincing the family to get into day trading. We were reluctant at first, and I wish it stayed that way.

In the background he worked with my parents in setting up a family company and opening trading accounts and buying courses. Keep in mind my parents will do anything he says, completely wrapped around his finger. During this time I was getting into the house flipping business in full swing. Working on my parents properties and going to auctions for future projects. I had already set up in my mind that I was going to be a real estate investor because it was the only work I actually enjoyed doing, my parents were very profitable, and even after the 2008 housing market crash, when we lost everything, they were able to bounce back.
Then one day everything stopped, my parents stopped working real estate and with no capital of my own I couldn’t continue doing it myself. 

They liquidated most of their assets and set up trading accounts with TD. They tried setting up weekly quotas and profit targets, which looking back, were really unrealistic. We needed 20k per month and sometimes more to cover loans from the very last rentals that hadn’t sold just yet. So naturally while they were on the market the quota for the month was 20k...for inexperienced day traders. It dawned on me that money is easy to make every month when a tenant gives it to you rather than we ourselves have to endure risk to make it, but my parents didn’t listen to me, it had to be my brothers way.

You can probably guess what happened. Loss after loss made our account grow smaller and smaller; and the smaller it got the more we had to risk to make bigger profits. Which only happened once where I made nearly 50k trading Netflix on its highest volume day in 2018. That quickly gotten absorbed by bills. But. By 2018 we were already down some 200k and our bills had been quickly eating up our saving. All the way to the point we starting taking loans just cover expenses and continue trading. Then one day I lost 80k on netflix when it’s earnings made it drop nearly a hundred dollars. If it went up well I’d be into real estate again. I nearly had a heart attack and stayed in bed for I don’t even know how long. If it weren’t for my girlfriend I think I might have killed myself.

We were forced to live in our last property for a few months before selling it to avoid foreclosure and then my entire family moved into a 1 bedroom apartment my brother still had in Pasadena. Which is an urban city so the rent was 3k. Which was nearly impossible to pay. We did Uber Eats deliveries every single day to just try to make enough money to eat and did some trading with money we borrowed from our extended family. All of our credit scores were shot and there was nothing left to borrow on. Then we sold our very last property and made 100k on the sale. Which we lost.

Nearly all of our losses were on options, and they were a direct result of our trading strategy, which was laughable. They set guidelines for the option expiration, loss tolerance, and investment amount(no swing trading). Which hey sounds great why not. Except that when our expenses were so great, the low risk meant we were burning more than we were making, the stress made me make some good and bad trades in an attempt to save my family from ruin. On some trades I would have made literal hundreds of thousands if my parents and older brother didn’t force sell my positions because they couldn’t stomach swing a loss(16k in HD $215 strike bought at $201 and it reached $215 a day before expiration which would have been a $170k profit because instead was forced to be a $2k loss). It really kills your heart to see how much money you could have made, not because you took profits too early, because no one believed you and took a loss on your behalf.

With no more options we packed up and moved to Maryland were my older brother got a 100k plus job coding websites. Things were good for a while and with no rush to cover rent or bills I was actually able to grow a small account from 4K to 17k. All good things must come to end sadly. He developed MS because of the stress of losing hundreds of thousands in a few years and his relationship was failing as well. These things affected his ability to learn new programing languages or work efficiently so his job fired him. Then it was up to me to make enough to cover the expenses and slowly I saw the account cannibalized to 0. They blame me almost exclusively for losing all the money by the way.

We moved back to California being forced to stay within the same apartment complex company because no where else will accept us. Now my brother is suicidal, he’s also diabetic and he’s tried killing himself by overdosing on insulin. His hope is at 0. I’ve matured more than any young adult should have from this ordeal so I feel like I can keep going. But moral is low. My parents work nearly 14 hours a day driving for Uber eats. I can’t really help because I had my ankle fused back in July. My other brother doesn’t live with us anymore because of all the chaos that happened. My parents have real estate licenses and they are trying really hard to find clients. I wish there was more I can do. I learned I should have fought more for our family to continue real estate investing. Nothing made us happier than flipping houses. If I had the opportunity to flip a house I’m sure we could jumpstart that career with my parents’ experience. I’m not against trading even after losing everything, sadly it took that much for me to do it half decently. I’m sticking to vertical spreads on etfs and precious metals, which brings in some profits every few weeks but not enough to make living. Sometimes I’ll use around $50 on near expiration out of the money calls of puts to try to get lucky. Sometimes the temptation to let my whole account ride on naked options is strong. Not because I want to be rich, but because I just want my parents to stop working so hard in something they don’t even enjoy doing at their age. I wanted to share my story because I saw how some of you guys shared similar experiences, and some of you were the exceptions that won in the end. Invest in real estate, it’s profitable if you work with someone who has experience and the market hasn’t tanked. I’m going to Texas in a few days to propose to my girlfriend and bring her back to California. If she says yes it’ll be the highlight of my life.

eipkeg,"Change my mind: Nothing is priced in, Stock market will always go up... Eventually...","Disclaimer: I'm a real estate investor, know nothing of stocks, but made 6% the few months I've been investing in stocks so there's that.

Re: Nothing priced in

I see this a lot, but it assumes everyone knows about a coming announcement which is impossible. People will always hear about an announcement the day of and \[jump on it\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQObWW06VAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQObWW06VAM)). Show me an example where a company gave a positive announcement and the stock went down same day? 

Re: Stocks will always go up

So, coming at the stock market from a real estate point of view. People will always need a place to live, short of there suddenly being less people in the US there will always be a market, always more consumption and a means to profit. Since on average according to this website

[https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/99-total-population-by-child-and-adult-populations#detailed/1/any/false/37,871,870,573,869,36,868,867,133,38/39,40,41/416,417](https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/99-total-population-by-child-and-adult-populations#detailed/1/any/false/37,871,870,573,869,36,868,867,133,38/39,40,41/416,417)

Two - three million people a year become adults. That's two or three more million people needing places to live or in this case 2-3 more million a year starting to invest. (I realize not all 18 year olds start investing... I'm not smart enough to give actual statics numbers so don't get all technical with me. Between 18-100 in one of those years people will move out of their parents or decide to start investing in their future... Point is population goes up, people don't stop \[fucking\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvdYly4A5W0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvdYly4A5W0))).

That said if there is always going to be more and more people buying into the stock market how can it go down? Sure news cycles can cause small dips here and there, but a full blown crash nah. Will people sell to take profits sure, can companies go bankrupt sure. What won't happen though is an event where people stop consuming all together.

I could ramble on but I know you autist will see the wall of text and run away.

eiq1os,"There should be no income tax, but much higher sales tax on goods in the United States.","The thing is, goods should cost more and people should be saving more. You shouldn't complain that non-essential items are more expensive. I will explain to you the long-term benefits which vastly outweigh the inconvenience of non-essential goods costing more and the current system in the US as well as many culturally similar consumer economies.

If you take my income only when I spend, I am essentially funding with consumerism. The benefit to me is that I get to consume more, and smarter. I have more personal capital as a result of not being taxed on income.

This is also simpler, putting behavioral economics aside. Taxing sales of goods means we have more control over our spending, and more autonomy.

Behaviorally, people would complain about their Starbucks and video games costing like 25% more, but you're stupid and greedy to complain about this. These are not only things you don't need, but it will result in better innovation and commitment from these products and companies. Your games will be better, because they worked harder to make something you'd actually pay the tax on. Your coffee will be sourced more ethically than ever because the sale of it directly goes to the state and federal government making it a political conflict or proxy war otherwise. Why would that change things? Because the feds would just pressure companies to find more ethical processes. It's not even our incompetent government's obligation beyond nagging Starbucks to stop using cheap Ecuadorian child labor.

Now how does this change your life? Well, you have more money now. You can save more, and you're economically obligated to because spending is potentially much more significant for basic luxury items.

Speaking of which, luxury goods would skyrocket. If you have a lot of money but taxes on purchases were huge, you'd think twice about what you'd buy and probably save up for the best headphones, car, etc. whatever. Thus everyone is going to be rolling around with brand new Lexus SUVs and Tesla Roasters. Why not? It makes sense to now. Likewise, economy vehicles would still thrive and --

Wait, how good does it sound to be a company in the nation that doesn't tax the income of their citizens? Everyone is a potential customer now. Everyone has some liquidity, you know it and you can feel it in this beautiful nation.

Now you may be looking at it another way if you're a grocery store or a business that provides essential human needs (utility, communications, news). That's fine, what we would need to do is track prepared vs. unprepared food goods. This way, we tax things like microwave dinners, but not the ingredients needed to make a similar meal. You're also spending way less money on food now for behavioral reasons and pricing reasons.

The government loves this. Why? They have tremendous negotiating power regarding tariffs. They don't need tariffs. They've taxed us already on what we choose to buy. This is an enormous deal. Why?

Not only does this mean we can put a price on the interest of goods on a fundamental operating basis which means no bad deals, we have the data and the transparency to know how much we need your oil, your chemicals, your metals, corn, pork, etc. so we can't be suckered into crazy prices and then?

We have tariffs anyway and take them out of deals for people we really like, such as South Korea or Japan. You do something we don't like? Unexpected tariffs. Why not? You're going to complain while the rest of the world's economies have you at 10%? We'll bump it to 2 or 4%, nothing crazy. Just enough to make them shit their pants when our policy advisors make it official on TV.

It incentivizes employment like nothing else. You get the money you worked for. It goes into your pocket, no one else's. The rest is up to you. The consumer empowerment is absurd.

The banks would love it. Lending would be at all time highs with probably similar interest rates as what we have today. They would probably also charge more for a checking account though.

That brings me to the one negative: When companies know you have money, they do everything in their power to take it out of your pocket and put it into theirs. That's their number one goal. We think we have a lot of subscription services today? It would be subscriptions for literally everything. You'd have to buy a subscription just to order pizza once. It would be subscription mayhem.

Counterpoint to that: People might demand the freedom away from subscriptions (probably not, especially with the lack of spending discipline today) because if we felt empowered by a lack of taxes, we might see subscriptions as an evil to consumers.

I think we can all agree though:

1. It's simpler than how we operate today, funding things by arbitrarily taking a portion of our income.
2. It would actually result in more taxes to the benefit of the nation, but feel like less because we are also satisfying emotional needs while we're taxed. We all spend more than we are taxed or there would be riots. Now we're taxed for what we spend creating surplus.
3. Surplus has the opportunity to unite people as we no longer argue over healthcare and education policy because we are taxed effectively with plenty of money to go to schools and hospitals, and reduce insurance costs.
4. It would encourage healthier eating due to not having tax on unprepared food. Healthier eating = less health care costs nationally.
5. You'd feel rich as hell if you got to keep every dollar you worked for.
6. We'd entice hardworking immigrants from around the world who genuinely want to make a good life for themselves by learning a trade and earning a wage.

Over the past few weeks I have dipped my feet into options trading, mostly following theta gang strategies, and I absolutely love it. Haven’t made a ton of money but that’s only because I recently unlocked level 3 options.

Storytime:

My friends and family keep saying the same shit, “it’s literally gambling, don’t light all your money on fire, save your money, invest in real estate blah blah blah”. 

Fuck that, I’m an autist.

I once got dragged behind a car trying to imitate back to the future. Wear a helmet? 

Fuck that I’m retarded.

At my first job out of college, I got pissed off when I discover my coworkers with less experience made slightly more money than me. I performed well and after about a year I got a laughable raise, and my boss told me he wants to make me a manager within a couple years blah blah blah more empty promises. Everyone telling me I’m doing great and have an amazing future at the company.

Fuck that I’m an autist. 

Found a new job contracting for even more money than I was trying to get at my last job, work there for a few months, same shit, they love me and wanna hire me full time, more talk of bright future. I ask for a ridiculous amount of money and they offer close to that but lower. Job security, huge company expansion, 401K, good money?

Fuck that I’m an autist.

I hop to another job for even more tendies. I doubled my original salary from my first job in only a few months. But my new job is boring as fuck and I just feel like I’m trapped in the rat race forever seeking more and more money doing jobs that I don’t like doing as my youthful years quickly pass by.

Whenever someone told me to follow the traditional path I did the opposite and it always worked out. My father has worked his entire life making tons of money and it was all wasted on bullshit college educations on kids that are doomed to repeat the cycle, doomed to be wagecucks forever.

Fuck that I’m an autist.

I’m not gonna spend my extra money from my job on shit I don’t need. I’m not gonna buy an overpriced house, I’m not gonna buy a fancy car, I’m going to trade options until I have $100K, enough money to quit my job and start focusing on things I actually wanna do.

eiund5,Vegas Math: How Does a Lady Gaga Residency Make Money for MGM?,"I was recently looking up Lady Gaga tickets, and I was surprised to see how expensive they were. However, I was even more surprised to see how much she alone is getting paid for the residency. Apparently, she is signed a two-year $100 MM deal for 74 shows:

https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lady-gaga-plots-las-vegas-residency-199241/

Ticket sales have been pulling in $1.41 MM - $1.48 MM per show. Even if we use the top end of that number and multiply it by the total number of shows, you get a number barely above $100 MM

74 x $1.48 MM = $109.52 MM

So, that’s less than $10 MM to cover all the other costs of 74 shows (including the marketing for it and what not). Even considering that most guests who go to the show will stay in a hotel (which may not may not even be an MGM property) and spend other money here, I don’t see how this could possibly be making much money on a net basis. And unless Lady Gaga has enough clout to pull in people who would not otherwise come to Vegas (and I’m too unaware of her current fan base to know if she does), people who go to this show and pay hundreds of dollars for tickets will likely just cut back on spending elsewhere on a Vegas trip. 

This just seems like an interesting business problem. I’m not sure how something like this could make money for MGM, but perhaps I’m missing a key element or two and I can be enlightened by some of you people here. I’m sure MGM would not spend this kind of cash if they didn’t think it would make a good return, but I just don’t see how these numbers could work in any meaningful way.
