Stonks is a web app that allows users to analyze a stock of their choosing with the Analysis Stonks System (ASS) method. The ASS method we created combines rudimentary machine learning with traditional financial analysis to give you the best picture of whether it's a good time to buy or a great time to buy.


Stonks utilizes a modified template from the Pytorch documentation for text-classification as well as traditional financial analysis with data from FinHub.
